A model of integer linear programming is formulated, the problem is shown to be NP-hard, and a genetic algorithm is proposed that takes into account the specifics of the problem. An experimental comparison of optimal solutions obtained using the CPLEX package with solutions found by the genetic algorithm is carried out. The computational experiment has shown the practically acceptable accuracy of the solutions obtained by the genetic algorithm and its applicability to large-dimensional problems.

During the beginning of the commercialization of the wireless networks, organizations and individuals connected without concern for the security of their system or network. Over time, it became apparent that some form of security was required to prevent outsiders from exploiting the connected resources. AES-CCMP (Advances Encryption Standard – Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Mode Protocol) is a new wireless security standard that provides the highest level of security by utilizing the newest and strongest 128-bit AES encryption algorithm to encrypt and authenticate the data at the same time. Efficient software implementation of AES-CCMP makes it computationally feasible to solve all sorts of security issues in wireless networks with ease of deployment. Implementation code is designed in C and compiled in Dev-C++ 4.9.9.1. Obtained results provide better throughput and less execution time as compare to other AES software implementations.

RESEARCH IN PROGRESS;no doi;2;aisel;atlason_et_al_2007;False;unknown;k.R.;Description We study a problem where manager of a call center should optimally allocate available resources (man-hours) to call handling and document creation (for knowledge management) tasks. The call center helps service engineers (performing equipment maintenance at client sites) in resolving problems that engineers face during the maintenance activities. Often when an engineer calls, he/she has to wait in a queue when all the call center professionals are busy, leading to wastage of production hours of the engineer. To avoid this situation, call center professionals also create documents addressing problems commonly faced by the engineers and make them available to the engineers through a knowledge management repository. Thus, the problem is to find an optimal allocation of call center resources so that the average waiting time in the queue is minimized. We analyze the model that reveals several important and counter-intuitive insights and provide guidelines for managers of the call center.

At the heart of IT Service support provider are the human resources that are expected to resolve tickets. It is essential that the policies, which govern the tickets’ movement amongst these resources, follow the business objectives such as service availability and cost reduction. In this study, we propose an agent based model that represents an IT Service Support system. A vital component in the model is the agent ‘Governor’, which makes policy decisions based on the by reacting to changes in the environment. The paper also studies the impact of various behavioural attributes of the Governor on the service objectives.

Calls arrive randomly over time, and the instantaneous arrival rates are allowed to vary both temporally and stochastically in an arbitrary manner. The objective is to minimize the sum of personnel costs and expected abandonment penalties by selecting an appropriate staffing level for each server pool. We propose a simple and computationally tractable method for solving this problem that requires as input only a few system parameters and historical call arrival data for each customer class, in this sense the method is said to be data-driven. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated via numerical examples. An asymptotic analysis establishes that the prescribed staffing levels achieve near-optimal performance and characterizes the magnitude of the optimality gap.

A salient feature of the model is that the mean arrival rate of work is random (in practice this is a typical consequence of forecasting errors). The paper elucidates the impact of uncertainty on the nature of capacity prescriptions, and relates these to well established rules-of-thumb such as the square-root safety staffing principle. We establish a simple and intuitive relationship between the incoming load (measured in Erlangs) and the extent of uncertainty in arrival rates (measured via the coefficient of variation) that characterizes the extent to which uncertainty dominates stochastic variability or vice versa. In the former case it is shown that traditional square-root safety staffing logic is no longer valid, yet simple capacity prescriptions derived via a suitable newsvendor problem are surprisingly accurate.

Specifically, we design optimal pricing and routing schemes for the setting where users cannot directly choose which station they can charge their vehicle at. Instead, they choose their priority level and energy request amount from the menu, and then the CNO directly assigns them to a station nearby. In designing our optimal pricing-routing policies, we consider the heterogeneity of the stations locations, electricity prices, and capacity, as well as the heterogeneity of users' values of time and energy requests. We design prices that incentivize users to reveal their true preferences to the CNO, as well as optimal routing schemes to allocate them to charging stations, under the scenario where the CNO is a social welfare maximizing entity.

Capacity planning of PEV charging infrastructure (EVCI) must ensure not only a satisfactory charging service for PEV users but also a reliable operation of the power grid. In this paper, we propose a quality-of-service (QoS) aware capacity planning of EVCI. In particular, the proposed framework accounts for the link between the charging QoS and the power distribution network (PDN) capability. Towards this end, we firstly optimize charging facility sizes to achieve a targeted QoS level. Then, we minimize the integration cost for the PDN by attaining the most cost-effective allocation of the energy storage systems (ESSs) and/or upgrading the PDN substation and feeders. Additionally, we capture the correlation between the occupation levels of neighboring charging facilities and the blocked PEV user behaviors. We model the EVCI as a queuing network with finite capacity, and utilize the non-stationary queuing models to study the temporal variability of the PEV charging demand. A network of charging facilities is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

The authors develop an analytical model describing perceptual congruence in a dyadic customer-employee relationship using a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function. This model allows the authors to describe a service context with three factors: 1) customer work-allocation level (that is, percent of work expected to be done by the customer), 2) customer-employee interaction level (that is, level of communication needed), and 3) customer-employee interaction type (that is, superiority or inferiority perceived by the customer and the employee in the interaction). The authors also calculate which type of customer-employee perceptual bias alignment is needed to achieve perceptual congruence under these three contextual factors. Their model may guide service managers how to manage perceptual biases -- considering their service design characteristics to achieve perceptual congruence.

The Emergency Center (EC) at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center treats 60 to 80 patients per day. The EC pharmacy processes and fills medication orders for EC patients 24 hours a day and fills medication orders for other clinics as needed after other pharmacies close. To identify ways to improve staffing and scheduling, we assessed needs for pharmacists and technicians in the pharmacy at different times of day and on different days of the week. All work activities done in the pharmacy were tabulated and then evaluated using time-motion analysis to determine standard times for each activity. Data were then analyzed from multiple institutional sources to determine the frequency of each activity by hour of day for weekdays and weekends. We developed Microsoft Excel macros to calculate recommended staffing for each position under baseline conditions and with changes in patient volume and work distribution. A scheduling tool was programmed to allow comparison of current staff schedules with staffing needs. Shift start times and shift lengths can be modified in the tool to change the number of staff at each hour of the day. These changes automatically update graphs that display recommended staffing and proposed staffing. This tool allows leadership to experiment with new staffing schedules in order to determine optimal coverage. The staffing model and scheduling tool can be used by the EC pharmacy to ensure appropriate staffing, create a safer environment in the EC, and provide the best care for patients.

The call center is modeled as a multi-server queue in which the staffing levels can be changed only at specific moments in time. The objective is to set the staffing levels such that a service level constraint is met in the presence of time-varying arrival rates. We develop a Markov decision model to obtain time-dependent staffing levels for both the case where the arrival rate function is known as well as unknown. The characteristics of the optimal policies associated to the two cases are illustrated through a numerical study based on real-life data. We show that the optimal policies provide a good balance between staffing costs and the penalty probability for not meeting the service level.

Particularly service processes have a high intrinsic need for flexibility. Many approaches have been proposed to determine the business value and an appropriate level of flexibility for service processes. Most of these approaches focus on a distinct flexibility type and on single projects for implementing flexible service processes. The question how to reasonably combine flexibility projects has not been addressed yet. Moreover, most approaches do not conduct a full-fledged economic analysis of process flexibility. We therefore propose a decision model that helps determine an optimal flexibility roadmap, i.e., a scheduled portfolio of flexibility projects with different effects on service processes. The decision model accounts for different request types (i.e., runners, repeaters, and strangers), different capacity types (i.e., internal, external, dedicated, and flexible), different flexibility types (i.e., volume and functional), and related project archetypes. The decision model was evaluated using feature comparison, prototype construction, and a demonstration example including an extensive scenario analysis

We show how to use the restricted fluid model with constant input rate to approximately solve scheduling control problems for a queue with constant arrival rate. The key is to characterize the invariant states of the fluid model, because they typically provide an approximation to the mean steady-state behavior of the queue under a wide range of scheduling policies. The resulting fluid control problem motivates using a static priority scheduling policy when the objective is to minimize the long-run average abandonment rate, but it may motivate a different class of scheduling policies when there are also holding costs. We end by discussing several open problems. Video of this TutORial from the 2019 INFORMS Annual Meeting in Seattle, Washington, October 22, 2019, is available at https://youtu.be/IH6349NgGgM.

Most papers investigating pricing problem in closed-loop supply chain field (CLSC) supposed that reproduced items’ quality is identical to produced ones. However, in practice, these items are perceived as two different products from customers’ perspective. Therefore, this paper extends a joint pricing model of manufactured–remanufactured items regarding different demands for produced and reproduced items which have different price and quality. We incorporate sales price, quality level, advertisement, return policy, and cross demand into demand expansion for newly produced items, and we discuss the introduction of collection effort and return policy into the quantity of return function. In this study, we investigate two distinct models. In the first model, we presume that there is no remanufacturing, so manufacturer sells products to retailer, and after that, the retailer sells them to customers. In the second model, with-remanufacturing which is comprised of three members (i.e., manufacturer, retailer, and third party) is discussed. Based on two different models, two decentralized problems are discussed for analyzing the best solutions of price, quality, and effort. Managerial insights indicate that adding reverse channel can greatly benefit both companies and environment and can also enhance firm’s position in the competitive market. Further to managerial insights, we determine and compare the optimum solution of two models, and we discuss the model that most benefits the manufacturer, retailer, and customers, respectively. Then an example is provided to simulate the developed problems and run sensitivity analyses to draw some interesting conclusions.

These dynamic routing and scheduling decisions are very difficult, because customers have different needs and servers have different skill levels. A further complication is that it is preferable that these decisions are made blindly, that is, they depend only on the system state and not on system parameter information such as call arrival rates and service speeds. This is because this information is generally not known with certainty. Ideally, a dynamic control policy for making routing and scheduling decisions balances customer and server needs by keeping customer delays low but still fairly dividing the workload amongst the various servers. In this paper, we propose a blind dynamic control policy for parallel-server systems with multiple customer classes and server pools that is based on the number of customers waiting and the number of agents idling. We show that in the Halfin-Whitt many-server heavy-traffic limiting regime, our proposed blind policy performs extremely well when the objective is to minimize customer holding costs subject to “server fairness,” as defined by how the system idleness is divided among servers. To do this, we formulate an approximating diffusion control problem (DCP) and compare the performance of the nonblind DCP solution to a feasible policy for the DCP that is blind. We establish that the increase in the DCP objective function value is small over a wide range of parameter values. We then use simulation to validate that a small increase in the DCP objective function value is indicative of our proposed blind policy performing very well.

We consider two different applications of stochastic monotonicity in performance evaluation. In the first one, we assume that a Markov chain of the model depends on a parameter that can be estimated only up to a certain level and we have only an interval that contains the exact value of the parameter. Instead of taking an approximated value for the unknown parameter, we show how we can use the monotonicity properties of the Markov chain to take into account the error bound from the measurements. In the second application, we consider a well known approximation method: the decomposition into Markovian submodels. In such an approach, models of complex networks or other systems are decomposed into Markovian submodels whose results are then used as parameters for the next submodel in an iterative computation. One obtains a fixed point system which is solved numerically. In general, we have neither an existence proof of the solution of the fixed point system nor a convergence proof of the iterative algorithm. Here we show how stochastic monotonicity can be used to answer these questions and provide, to some extent, the theoretical foundations for this approach. Furthermore, monotonicity properties can also help to derive more efficient algorithms to solve fixed point systems.

We present a strategy for selecting forecast models of call arrivals which is based on three pillars: (i) flexibility of the loss function, (ii) statistical evaluation of forecast accuracy, and (iii) economic evaluation of forecast performance using money metrics. We implement fourteen time series models and seven forecast combination schemes on three series of daily call arrivals. Although we focus mainly on point forecasts, we also analyze density forecast evaluation. We show that second-moment modeling is important for both point and density forecasting and that the simple seasonal random walk model is always outperformed by more general specifications. Our results suggest that call center managers should invest in the use of forecast models which describe both first and second moments of call arrivals.

Furthermore, common factors are able to capture not only regular dynamics (stationary or not) but also seasonal ones, by means of the common factors following a multiplicative seasonal VARIMA(p, d, q) × (P, D, Q)s model. Additionally, a bootstrap procedure that does not need a backward representation of the model is proposed to be able to make inference for all the parameters in the model. A bootstrap scheme developed for forecasting includes uncertainty due to parameter estimation, allowing enhanced coverage of forecasting intervals. A challenging application is provided. The new proposed model and a bootstrap scheme are applied to an innovative subject in electricity markets: the computation of long-term point forecasts and prediction intervals of electricity prices.

Motivated by Van Meighem (2003), who shows the asymptotic optimality of the generalized longest queue policy for the problem of minimizing the due date dependent expected delay costs when there is a single agent, we develop a class of index-based policies that is a generalization of the priority first-come-first-serve, weighted shortest expected processing time and generalized longest queue policy. In our simulation study of an assignment system of a large technology firm, the index-based policy shows an improvement of 0-20 % over the priority first-come-first-serve policy depending upon the load conditions.

Academic/practical relevance: It is widespread practice, across disparate businesses, to staff project teams with subcontracted workers—and yet, despite the prevalence of this phenomenon, there is scant research on how subcontracted workers impact project performance. Investigating such an effect is important because past findings on the effects of subcontracting in retail or assembly lines cannot be hastily extrapolated to the more qualified workers and more demanding tasks normally associated with project environments. Methodology: Building on previous findings about the higher motivation level of subcontracted versus permanent workers when the latter are protected from individual dismissal by the law, we develop hypotheses to conceptualize how and under what conditions subcontracted workers positively impact project performance. We then test our hypotheses by analyzing 413 projects of a European high-tech firm. Results: We find that with increased use of subcontracted workers comes increased project profit margins. This positive effect is stronger for larger teams and weaker when large project scope changes occur or when higher-skilled workers are subcontracted. We also find this effect to be stronger when subcontracted workers are involved in technical rather than administrative roles and when subcontractors join in the later stages of the project. Managerial implications: This study offers guidelines on how project managers can use subcontracting to increase project margins, highlighting strategic and tactical factors that affect the benefits of using subcontracted labor.

In these queueing systems, customers do not or cannot renege, and further, the system may not lend itself to analysis under Markovian assumptions. Under these circumstances, managers tasked with improving system performance need methods of identifying improvement strategies that queueing theory may not make readily apparent. We develop a generic system dynamics (SD) queueing model, which reveals variables that may be significant contributors to queueing performance but may not be explicitly considered in traditional queueing models. The SD model identifies three classes of variables associated with the cognitive cycle, i.e., system customers and servers perform functions related to detection, interpretation, and action. Via simulation, we apply the generic model to passport inspection stations at John F. Kennedy International Airport then develop a matrix, which demonstrates options for addressing system performance beyond increasing the number of servers.

The model measures service level as the fraction of calls reached within a given time standard and considers response time to be composed of a random delay (prior to travel to the scene) plus a random travel time. In addition to modeling the uncertainty in the delay and in the travel time, we incorporate uncertainty in the ambulance availability in determining the response time. Models that do not account for the uncertainty in all three of these components may overestimate the possible service level for a given number of ambulances and underestimate the number of ambulances needed to provide a specified service level. By explicitly modeling the randomness in the ambulance availability and in the delays and the travel times, we arrive at a more realistic ambulance location model. Our model is tractable enough to be solved with general-purpose optimization solvers for cities with populations around one Million. We illustrate the use of the model using actual data from Edmonton.

When order-picking activities can only be performed in specific time windows, it is essential to jointly solve the order picker shift scheduling problem and the order picker planning problem of assigning and sequencing individual orders to order pickers. This requires decisions regarding the number of order pickers to schedule, shift start and end times, break times, as well as the assignment and timing of order-picking activities. We call this the order picker scheduling problem and present two formulations. A branch-and-price algorithm and a metaheuristic are developed to solve the problem. Numerical experiments illustrate that the metaheuristic finds near-optimal solutions at 80% shorter computation times. A case study at the largest supermarket chain in The Netherlands shows the applicability of the solution approach in a real-life business application. In particular, different shift structures are analyzed, and it is concluded that the retailer can increase the minimum compensated duration for employed workers from six hours to seven or eight hours while reducing the average labor cost with up to 5% savings when a 15-minute flexibility is implemented in the scheduling of break times.

The manufacturer and the subcontractor differ in terms of costs, production capacities, rates, and service level capabilities. Using Markov decision process models, we determine the optimal policy and characterize its structure. We derive the set of conditions that partitions the state space into regions and characterize optimal policies in each region. We derive optimal policies for manufacturer and subcontractors under different settings and show that the optimal policy has a multi-index structure in some settings.

In these situations, effective medical response plays a crucial role in saving life. To model medical rescue activities, a two-priority non-preemptive S-server, and a finite capacity queueing system is considered. After constructing Chapman–Kolmogorov differential equations, Pontryagin's minimum principle is used to calculate optimal treatment rates for each priority class. The performance criterion is to minimize both the expected value of the square of the difference between the number of servers and the number of patients in the system, and also the cost of serving these patients over a determined time period. The performance criterion also includes a final time cost related to deviations from the determined value of the desired queue length. The two point boundary value problem is numerically solved for different arrival rate patterns and selected parameters.

The aim of the call center manager is to allocate and dynamically update the workforce so that the incoming calls are answered in the shortest possible time, above certain service level measures. The software tools developed to aid decision making in these areas use the models that are based on Erlang C calculations. However the strict assumptions of Erlang-C often lead to invalid decisions. Especially at peak times during the day, dynamic updates in the proposed design is inevitable. In this study, a framework for a decision support system is proposed for designing the shifts and allocating the agent workforce to the shifts in a call center, so that target service levels are met. In the proposed system, shifts are designed by solving a linear optimization model. Using this solution as the input, a simulation model is developed to dynamically update the workforce design so that the minimum required service level is met at all times. The proposed DSS is illustrated on an existing call center system, alternative designs are generated and compared.

Constraints are imposed on the service level for each call class, defined here as the steady-state fraction of calls served within a given time threshold, excluded. An approximation of these service levels is developed that allows an arbitrary overflow mechanism and customer abandonment. A two-stage heuristic that finds good solutions to mathematical programs with such constraints is developed. The first stage uses search methods supported by the approximation. Because service level approximation errors may be substantial, the solution is adjusted in a second stage in which performance is estimated by simulation. Realistic problems of varying size and routing policy are solved. The proposed approach is shown to be competitive with (and often better than) previously available methods.

Given that firms routinely offer a portfolio of vertically differentiated products, a crucial question facing such firms is whether such differentiation should also be extended to associated services. Service differentiation lowers cannibalization of the high-quality product by the low-quality product and increases revenues, but it requires dedicated capacity which increases the cost of offering service. This tradeoff is further confounded by the potential loss of service performance due to complexity involved in single set of resources serving multiple segments. Thus, we examine this service strategy decision along the two dimensions: cannibalization concerns and complexity involved in serving multiple segments together. We consider a firm whose customers vary in their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for product quality and their sensitivity to service levels, and can self-select across offered products. We find that even when there is no complexity involved in serving multiple segments, the differentiated service strategy may be preferred purely to prevent cannibalization. With high complexity, cannibalization concerns may increase or decrease the firm’s preference for the differentiated service strategy depending on the demand mix of higher and lower WTP customers. Cannibalization also makes the role of total demand size in the service strategy decision more pronounced. Specifically, changes in capacity costs, customer heterogeneity and product differentiation may make the differentiated service strategy more or less attractive depending on the total demand size as well as the demand mix.

At an operational level, it is important to fully utilize and coordinate technicians in order to increase efficiency of the short-term maintenance planning. In this paper, we investigate sharing of technicians between wind farms over multiple periods, while determining per period vessel routes for delivering and picking up technicians. The problem can be considered as a novel variant of the multi-period multi-commodity pickup and delivery problem. We develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search heuristic which achieves high-quality, and often optimal, solutions on benchmark instances from the literature. The heuristic is used to explore the benefits of different sharing policies. By sharing technicians, both the flexibility of the daily planning is improved and the expected maintenance costs are reduced. In addition, the increased flexibility results in fewer vessel trips and increases the decision maker’s ability to cope with extreme scenarios encountered in the short-term maintenance planning.

Proper allocation of resources to match demand is, therefore, a vital task for many emergency departments. Constrained by targets on patient waiting time, we consider the problem of minimizing the total amount of staff-resources allocated to an emergency department. We test a matheuristic approach to this problem, accounting for both patient flow and staff scheduling restrictions. Using a continuous-time Markov chain, patient flow is modeled as a time-dependent queueing network where inhomogeneous behavior is evaluated using the uniformization method. Based on this modeling approach, we recursively evaluate and allocate staff to the system using integer linear programming until the waiting time targets are respected in all queues of the network. By comparing to discrete-event simulations of the associated system, we show that this approach is adequate for both modeling and optimizing the patient flow. In addition, we demonstrate robustness to the service time distribution and the associated system with multiple classes of patients.

This paper examines and compares the accuracy of three representative parametric and non-parametric prediction models, selected by the analysis of the numerous methods proposed in the literature for their good combination of forecast accuracy and ease of calibration, using real-life data on Italian motorway stretches. Non-parametric K-NN regression model, Gaussian maximum likelihood model and double seasonality Holt–Winters exponential smoothing model confirm their goodness to predict the weekly and monthly fluctuations of average daily traffic with varying degrees of performance, while maintaining an easy use in professional practice, i.e. requiring ordinary professional skills and conventional analysis tools. Since combining several prediction models can give, on average, more accuracy than that of the individual models, the paper compares two weighting methods of easy implementation and susceptible to a direct use, namely the widely used information entropy method and the less widespread Shapley value method. Despite being less common than the information entropy method, the Shapley value method proves to be more capable in better combining single forecasts and produces improvements in the predictions for test data. With these remarks, the paper might be of interest to traffic technicians or analysts, in various and not uncommon tasks they might find in their work.

Forecasting (or prediction), similarly to other data mining tasks, uses empirical evidence to select the most suitable model for a problem at hand since no modeling method can be considered as the best. However, according to our systematic literature review of the last decade, few scientific publications rigorously expose the benefits and limitations of the most popular algorithms for time series prediction. At the same time, there is a limited performance record of these models when applied to complex and highly nonlinear data. In this paper, we present one of the most extensive, impartial and comprehensible experimental evaluations ever done in the time series prediction field. From 95 datasets, we evaluate eleven predictors, seven parametric and four non-parametric, employing two multi-step-ahead projection strategies and four performance evaluation measures. We report many lessons learned and recommendations concerning the advantages, drawbacks, and the best conditions for the use of each model. The results show that SARIMA is the only statistical method able to outperform, but without a statistical difference, the following machine learning algorithms: ANN, SVM, and kNN-TSPI. However, such forecasting accuracy comes at the expense of a larger number of parameters. The evaluated datasets, as well detailed results achieved by different indexes as MSE, Theil’s U coefficient, POCID, and a recently-proposed multi-criteria performance measure are available online in our repository. Such repository is another contribution of this paper since other researchers can replicate our results and evaluate their methods more rigorously. The findings of this study will impact further research on this topic since they provide a broad insight into models selection, parameters setting, evaluation measures, and experimental setup.

This article employs the contingency theory of organizations to explain the gap between the practice and the academic models of production planning. Arguments on the contingency effects of process complexity lead to a hypothesis that expects simple capacity planning methods to be most effective in certain production processes. A strong inference research setting is used to test the contingency hypothesis against a conventional hypothesis that expects the most sophisticated planning techniques to always be most effective. Multisource data from the machinery manufacturing industry support the contingency hypothesis and reject the universalistic hypothesis. The findings are explained using the concepts of task interdependence and bounded rationality. The results have several managerial implications, and they elaborate how classic concepts in organization theory can bring practically relevant insights to operations management research.

Most previous approaches used a two-step procedure: (1) determine staffing requirements and (2) find a minimum cost schedule that provides the required staffing in every period. Approximations in the first step sometimes cause the two-step approach to find infeasible or suboptimal solutions. Our method iterates between a schedule evaluator and a schedule generator. The schedule evaluator calculates transient service levels using the randomization method and identifies infeasible intervals, where the service level is lower than desired. The schedule generator solves a series of integer programs to produce improved schedules, by adding constraints for every infeasible interval, in an attempt to eliminate infeasibility without eliminating the optimal solution. We present computational results for several test problems and discuss factors that make our approach more likely to outperform previous approaches.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the pricing strategies as well as the quality level and effort decisions of the manufacturer, retailer, and third party operating in two types of closed-loop supply chains: (1) single-channel forward supply chain with a dual-recycling channel (SD model) and (2) dual-channel forward supply chain with a dual-recycling channel (DD model). On the basis of these different channel structures, two manufacturer Stackelberg game models are developed to explore the best values for prices, quality levels, and sales and collection efforts. In addition, to draw managerial insights, corresponding equilibrium solutions of the two model structures are determined and compared, and the channel structure that most benefits each supply chain member is examined. To reduce channel conflicts and increase each channel member’ profits, a novel coordination mechanism is introduced and discussed. Two numerical examples are presented to simulate the strategies for choosing the best channel format for a decentralized closed-loop supply chain and examine the effectiveness of the coordination contract. The results revealed that the DD model is the best for the manufacturer, and the optimal channel structure for the retailer depends on the retailer's market share. However, by applying a novel coordination mechanism, all three members of a closed-loop supply chain can benefit from the introduction of an online selling channel. Furthermore, the results showed that the quality of products in the DD model is always greater than it is for products in the SD model. Moreover, it is observed from the sensitivity analysis that the recycling channel member with a predominant market share exerts greater collections effort and offers lower buyback prices than others in the collection channel.

Let us recall that fuzzy regression generalizes the concept of classical (numeric) regression in the sense of bringing additional capabilities that allow the model to deal with fuzzy (granular) data. We show that a convex hull method provides a useful vehicle to reduce computing time, which becomes of particular relevance in case of real-time data analysis. Our objective is to develop an efficient real-time fuzzy regression analysis based on the use of convex hull, specifically a Beneath-Beyond algorithm. In this algorithm, the re-construction of convex hull edges depends on incoming vertices while a re-computing procedure can be realized in real-time. We demonstrate the use of the developed enhancement to application to unit performance assessment and air pollution data. An important role of convex hull is contrasted with the limitations of linear programming used in the “standard” regression.

Five performance criteria affect the performance of Alarm Monitoring Center and five factors, each of which has three control levels, are identified. The data belonging to the performance criteria, which are determined, are obtained with the help of the running scenarios combining with the factor levels using Taguchi design. Then, signals to the noise (S/N) ratios are calculated for these which are obtained from the performance data. A decision matrix is generated with S/N ratios, the TOPSIS method is used to transfer the multi-response problems into the single-response problems. The system improvement rate is also determined by finding the levels of factors to optimize the system using Taguchi’s single response optimization methodology.

For this purpose, in an M/M/s queue setting, we prove that the optimal discipline gives priority to the oldest customer who has waited less than the acceptable waiting time. Next, we derive explicitly the performance measures. Finally, we show that although this discipline may reduce staffing costs, it leads to excessive wait for non-prioritized customers.

Our aim is to find a good balance between conflicting goals, namely, the rate of rejected customers and a cost function which may involve wait and abandonment metrics like percentiles of the waiting time or rate of abandonment. We develop a Markov decision process approach where the waiting time of the first customer in line is used in a discretized form to define the system state. We show that a time-based threshold policy is optimal, and develop a procedure to compute the optimal threshold. Our analysis explains some known behaviors in practice. For instance, if the cost function is constant in the system state like with wait percentiles, then the optimal threshold is one of the time limits defining the percentiles. Also, abandonment is shown to have beneficial or detrimental effect depending on the system manager’s objective.

We study this question in a single-server queue under a principal-agent framework. The principal seeks to reduce the expected waiting time by incentivizing the agent to modify the service rate through a performance-based payout. We show that a large range of improvement is achievable by selecting event-dependent service rates. However, the agent’s payout can grow high in the realized improvement, suggesting to limit the use of incentives for event-dependent service rates to a bounded waiting time improvement. When the service rate after an arrival is contractible, the agent should be paid more in contexts with a low variability inter-arrival time. The opposite conclusion holds when the average service rate is contractible. Further, we provide a criterion to determine when it is optimal for the agent to accelerate after an arrival or after a service completion. Finally, we investigate the effect of event-dependency on customers’ fairness and abandonment.

We propose a model combining the DeLone & McLean IS success model and the Task Technology Fit (TTF) model to evaluate the impact of m-banking on individual performance. The empirical approach is based on an online survey questionnaire of 233 individuals. The results reveal that use and user satisfaction are important precedents of individual performance, and the importance of the moderating effects of TTF over usage to individual performance. The system quality, information quality, and service quality positively affect user satisfaction. Understanding the significance of m-banking context on individual performance is useful to provide new insight to m-banking managers to apply strategies to retain users or even attract potential adopters. We provide the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.

It is motivated by practical situations faced by the agricultural stage of sugarcane mills. Due to the frequent changes in the locations of harvest fronts, the emergency calls for tire repair also change their locations over time, and managers should determine the appropriate number and locations of servers and their dispatch policies. This approach is applied to a case study conducted in the tire repair emergency services of a sugarcane mill. A simulation model is also developed to crosscheck the validity of this approach. This work aims at analyzing and highlighting the importance of considering time-dependent changes in arrival rates at different regions of the system. The findings suggest that this approach is flexible enough to deal with alternative dispatch policies, changes in the number of servers, and the increase in server utilization rates.

This is contrary to extant methods that are mostly reactive and only rely on data available from the OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). The paper proposes hazard rate models to link upstream supply chain quality/testing information as explanatory covariates for early detection of reliability problems. In doing so, it improves both the accuracy of reliability problem detection as well as the lead time for detection. The proposed methodology is illustrated and validated using real-world data from a leading Tier-1 automotive supplier.

Both are random and unobservable, affecting the spread of the disease, patient arrivals to health care units (HCUs) and the number of deaths. A novel, inventory perspective of COVID-19 is proposed, with random inflow, random losses and retrials (recurrent cases) and delayed/distributed exit, with randomly varying fractions of the exit distribution. A minimal construal, it enables representation of COVID-19 evolution with close fit of national incidence profiles, including single and multiple pattern outbreaks, oscillatory, periodic or non-periodic evolution, followed by retraction, leveling off, or strong resurgence. Furthermore, based on asymptotic laws, the minimum number of variables that must be monitored for identifying CaL and IR is determined and a real-time identification method is presented. The method is data-driven, utilizing the entry rate to HCUs and scaled, or dimensionless variables, including the mean residence time of symptomatic carriers in CaL and the mean residence time in CaL of patients entering HCUs. As manifested by several robust case studies of national COVID-19 incidence profiles, it provides efficient identification in real-time under unbiased monitoring error, without relying on any model. The propagation factor, a stochastic process, is reconstructed from the identified trajectories of CaL and IR, enabling evaluation of control measures. The results are useful towards the design of policies restricting COVID-19 and encumbrance to HCUs and mitigating economic contraction.

Thereby, we consider the situation that the service vendor executes certain activities by himself whereas specific parts of the business process are outsourced to external providers. For the outsourced parts, the vendor can choose between different models of capacity supply (MCS) that are offered by external providers differentiating with respect to elasticity of provided capacity and the underlying pricing model. Thereby, in addition to the two “traditional” MCS dedicated capacity and elastic capacity, recent developments in information technology enable the on-demand use of surplus capacity from an external providers' market. Since an integrated analysis of these three MCS is still missing in common literature, we develop an optimization model allowing for the simultaneous consideration of the three different MCS within an integrated queuing system. By analyzing the optimization model with help of a discrete event simulation, we study the question of how these different MCS may be combined to minimize the total operating costs of the service vendor considering volatile demand. The simulation results show that combining different MCS tends to be favorable in contrast to the stand-alone usage of a certain MCS. In particular, combining the additional option of using surplus capacity with “traditional” MCS promises cost advantages. Our optimization model therewith provides first insights in the potential economic benefits of IT-enabled MCS.

In the first problem, the goal is to determine an optimal policy for switching workers between the two rooms. In the second and third problems, the goal is to determine the minimum number of workers that should be hired by the facility such that a satisfactory switching policy exists. We analyze two questions arising from previous work on these problems. Firstly, we demonstrate that the previously proposed policy definition is sub-optimal and cannot represent a set of solutions that are reasonable in practice, and propose an alternative definition. Secondly, we examine the problem of finding the optimal combination of cross-trained and specialized workers under a complete set of assumptions regarding worker costs. This analysis shows that the structure of the optimal solution depends on the policy definition that is employed. Moreover, under some assumptions the cost of the ‘optimal’ solution with the original policy definition will be greater than the cost of the optimal solution with the new one.

Even though Dynamic Programming and other alternate approaches have been implemented to solve assignment problems in production systems with independent stations and independent jobs while maximizing output, such solutions are generally not optimal. In this paper, we develop results that reveal the form of the optimal solution, which allows us to solve the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), rather than the more complex MINLP. We examine the effectiveness of this information to reduce the time complexity of the problem. As the presented methodology is independent of the productivity model, it has general application, irrespective of the specific learning/forgetting models employed. The approach is relevant in the context of a set of tasks with some task similarity, learning and forgetting among the workforce, and equal or unequal numbers of workers and tasks.

ETS (exponential smoothing) has received extensive attention in the recent years since the invention of its state space formulation. In this work, we combine these models with knowledge based heuristic time series decomposition methods to improve the forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency. In particular, three decomposition methods are proposed. The first method implements an additive seasonal-trend decomposition as a preprocessing technique prior to ETS. This can reduce the state space thus improve the computational efficiency. The second method decomposes the GHI (global horizontal irradiance) time series into a direct component and a diffuse component. These two components are used as forecasting model inputs separately, and their corresponding results are recombined via the closure equation to obtain the GHI forecasts. In the third method, the time series of the cloud cover index is considered. ETS is applied to the cloud cover time series to obtain the cloud cover forecast thus the forecast GHI through polynomial regressions. The results show that the third method performs the best among three methods and all proposed methods outperform the persistence models.

A stationary Markovian queueing model with customer abandonment is employed to determine required staffing levels for a sequence of time intervals with varying call volumes, handling times, and relative agent availabilities. These staffing requirements populate a quadratic programming model for determining the distribution of agent tours that will maximize the fraction of offered calls beginning service within a target response time, subject to side constraints on tour type quantities. The optimal distribution is scaled to reflect the total number of scheduled agents, and a near-optimal integer solution is derived using rounding thresholds found by successive one-dimensional searches. This novel approach has been successfully implemented in large service centers at Qwest Communications and could easily be adapted to other operational environments.

In addition to the complex intraday, intraweek and intrayear seasonal cycles, call arrival data typically contain a large number of anomalous days, driven by the occurrence of holidays, special events, promotional activities and system failures. This study evaluates the use of a variety of univariate time series forecasting methods for forecasting intraday call arrivals in the presence of such outliers. Apart from established, statistical methods, we consider artificial neural networks (ANNs). Based on the modelling flexibility of the latter, we introduce and evaluate different methods to encode the outlying periods. Using intraday arrival series from a call centre operated by one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, we provide new insights on the impact of outliers on the performance of established forecasting methods. Results show that ANNs forecast call centre data accurately, and are capable of modelling complex outliers using relatively simple outlier modelling approaches. We argue that the relative complexity of ANNs over standard statistical models is offset by the simplicity of coding multiple and unknown effects during outlying periods.

However in the short to medium term where decisions concerning the scheduling of agents are required, the SMA method is usually outperformed. This study is the first systematic evaluation of the SMA method across averages of different lengths using call arrival data sampled at different frequencies from 5 min to 1 h. A hybrid method which combines the strengths of the SMA method and nonlinear data-driven artificial neural networks (ANNs) is proposed to improve short-term accuracy without deteriorating long-term performance. Results of forecasting the intraday call arrivals to banks in the US, UK and Israel indicate that the proposed method outperforms standard benchmarks, and leads to improvements in forecasting accuracy across all horizons.

Our approach integrates customer arrival forecasting, service time estimation, and staffing into an end to end process. More specifically, (i) we propose a hybrid model to forecast customer arrivals, that combines a traditional time-series technique with a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm, thereby allowing to incorporate a rich set of predictors, (ii) we develop a methodology to estimate the distribution of load-dependent service times from past transactions data, and (iii) we present a stochastic programming formulation to determine staffing levels under quality-of-service constraints. Finally, we develop a heuristic solution algorithm that utilizes an embedded discrete event simulation to evaluate system performance. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we conduct a case study at a franchisee of a major international fast food chain. Our data set includes the number of transactions, average order value, average service times, and staffing levels recorded at the restaurant on an hourly level, as well as information on marketing activities of the fast food chain on a daily level for nine consecutive years. We show that by applying our approach, the personnel expenses could be reduced by 4.4%, which would translate into an increase in earnings before interest and taxes by 13% at the collaborating restaurant.

In metropolitan cities such as Istanbul and Mumbai, call centers provide the transportation of their staff so that shuttle costs constitute a significant part of the operational costs. We develop a mixed integer programming model that incorporates the shuttle requirements at the beginning and end of the shifts into the agent-shift assignment decisions, while considering the skill sets of the agents, and other constraints due to workforce regulations and agent preferences. We analyze model solutions for a banking call center under various management priorities to understand the interactions among the conflicting objectives. We show that considering transportation costs as well as agent preferences in agent-shift assignments provides significant benefits in terms of both cost savings and employee satisfaction.

Data have come from the Offshoring Research Network (ORN) and have been analysed using an Exploratory Factor Analysis to aggregate variables first and then through a two-stage approach to control for the potential endogeneity problem arising from the self-selection bias in the regression models. Through these models we investigate the relationship between the motivations leading to choose a specific offshoring location (i.e. strategic location drivers: low cost, resources availability, cultural proximity, and the presence of local networks) and both operational and strategic performance of the offshoring firm. Provided that offshoring may occur either through a wholly-owned subsidiary (captive offshoring) or by outsourcing the service activity (offshore outsourcing), we provide a contribution by investigating the moderating role of the governance model on the relationship between location drivers and performance. Our results show that both operational and strategic performance are affected positively by low cost and resources availability, while local networks has a positive impact on strategic performance and negative one on operational performance. Moreover, offshore outsourcing strengthens the effect of resources availability and local networks on operational performance, as well the effect of cultural proximity and resource availability on strategic performance, while captive offshoring strengthens the effect of low cost and local networks on strategic performance.

This study clarifies customer evaluations of call centers with a field study that examines how customer perceptions of a foreign accent, call center location, and the agent's customer orientation relate to nonmonetary performance outcomes. Multivariate analysis of data collected from more than 800 customers using call centers located in three countries suggests that neither accent detection nor call center location relates to customer satisfaction, trust, or word-of-mouth communication, only perceived customer orientation has an effect on these outcomes. These findings suggest offshore call center locations are not necessarily associated with lower performance outcomes and that service firms should place a higher priority on ensuring call center agents have a strong customer orientation, rather than on avoiding the use of call centers abroad.

As call centers have become the primary contact point between patients and emergency service providers, the planning of the call center has become a key task for administrators. Objectives The aim of this study is to apply a widely used operations management method, the newsvendor model, for optimizing the capacity level in EMS call centers with a minimum cost in order to efficiently meet the calls arriving. Methods Real-life data from a call center for ambulance services in a major city in Turkey was used. We propose using the newsvendor model for optimizing this call center's capacity level based on the forecasts of periodic call volumes via basic methods. Results Ambulance service call volumes vary during the day and weekday call profiles are different from weekends. By separating the analysis into weekdays and weekends and illustrating shorter time intervals within the days, call volume can be forecast. Taking not only the point forecast but also the variation of the forecast into account, the capacity level of each period can be planned in a cost-effective way. Conclusions This paper provides a basis for operation planning strategies of ambulance services by reconsidering the uncertainties of demand. The newsvendor model, which works well under parameter uncertainty, can be used in planning the capacities of health care services, especially when high service levels are required.

In this paper, we consider the operation planning problem involving vehicle dispatching, relocation, and recharging decisions. We model the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to generate the optimal policy that maximizes the total profits. We propose a flexible policy to provide optimal actions according to the reward considering future requests and vehicle availability. We show that our model outperforms the predetermined rules on improving profits. To handle the curse-of-dimensionality caused by the large scale of state space and uncertainty, we develop an asynchronous learning method to solve the problem by approximating the value function. We first draw the samples of exogenous information and update the quality of approximations based on the quality of decisions, then approximate the exact cost-to-go value function by solving an approximation subproblem efficiently given the state at each period. Two variant algorithms are presented for cases with scarce and sufficient information. We also incorporate the state aggregation and post-decision analysis to further improve computational efficiency. We use a set of shared actual data from Didi platform to verify the proposed model in numerical experiments. To conclude, we extract managerial insights that suggest important guidelines for the ride-hailing operations planning problem.

Recently it has been shown that sums of Kronecker products can be used to represent the nonzero blocks of the transition rate matrix underlying an LDQBD process for models from stochastic chemical kinetics. This paper extends the form of the transition rates used recently so that a larger class of models including those of call centers can be analyzed for their steady-state. The challenge in the matrix analytic solution then is to compute conditional expected sojourn time matrices of the LDQBD model under low memory and time requirements after truncating its countably infinite state space judiciously. Results of numerical experiments are presented using a Kronecker-based matrix-analytic solution on models with two or more countably infinite dimensions and rules of thumb regarding better implementations are derived. In doing this, a more recent approach that reduces memory requirements further by enabling the computation of steady-state expectations without having to obtain the steady-state distribution is also considered.

As a stepping stone for the competitive model, we begin by studying a monopolist’s capacity decision, where the key trade-off is between the cost of extra capacity for low demand periods and the loss of revenue for high demand periods, we provide an attractive rule of thumb for capacity decisions in this setting. We then study a duopoly model, where lost demand for one firm may become increased demand for the competitor. In both models we use a fluid model for the analysis, which allows us both to provide explicit insights into the trade-offs when setting capacity and to solve for the Nash equilibrium (when it exists) in the duopoly. The canonical environment we have in mind for our modeling is a food court, but any service environment where the peak arrival rate will likely exceed available capacity is similarly appropriate.

The unique features of the model include the modelling of a risk factor measured by period non-performing loans (NPLs). Specifically, NPLs enter in the second stage of banks production processes, alongside a human capital factor. The model is applied to Japanese local Shinkin banks over the period 2008–2015. The findings highlight the importance of incorporating previous period NPLs and human capital factors when modelling bank production processes. Moreover, we provide evidence that previous period NPLs act as an endogenous risk factor having a negative effect on bank profit efficiency levels. The empirical findings suggest that the human capital factor has a positive effect on bank profit efficiency levels. Finally, both the effect of NPLs and human capital factor has an asymmetric effect on bank performance levels.

In this paper, a forecasting method is proposed, which has a strong capability of predicting highly fluctuating demand data. Therefore, in this paper we propose a demand forecasting method based on multi-layer LSTM networks. The proposed method automatically selects the best forecasting model by considering different combinations of LSTM hyperparameters for a given time series using the grid search method. It has the ability to capture nonlinear patterns in time series data, while considering the inherent characteristics of non-stationary time series data. The proposed method is compared with some well-known time series forecasting techniques from both statistical and computational intelligence methods using demand data of a furniture company. These methods include autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing (ETS), artificial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), support vector machines (SVM) and single layer LSTM. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is superior among the tested methods in terms of performance measures.

The ultimate goal of the proposed approach is to open a broader workforce scheduling paradigm that incorporates service quality into the analysis and provides the possibility to study the interaction between cost and service quality. Furthermore, the approach enables us to avoid strong assumptions. An example with real-world, empirical demand data is provided.

In addition to the classical costs for inventory holding, outdating, and shortage, our model includes substitution (mismatch) costs incurred when a demand for a certain-aged item is satisfied by a different-aged item. We propose a simple inventory replenishment and allocation heuristic to minimize the expected total cost over an infinite time horizon. In our heuristic, inventory of the newest items is replenished in fixed quantities and the newest items are protected for future use by limiting some substitutions when making allocation decisions according to a critical-level policy. We model our problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), derive the costs of our heuristic policy, and computationally compare this policy to extant “near optimal” policies in the literature. Our extensive computational study shows that our policy leads to superior performance compared to existing heuristics in the literature, particularly when supplies are limited.

This article focuses in particular on the operations of the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust (WAST), which is the only organisation that provides urgent paramedical care services on a day-to-day basis across the whole of Wales. In response to WAST’s aspiration to improve the quality of care it provides, this research investigates several interrelated advanced statistical and operational research (OR) methods, culminating in a suite of decision support tools to aid WAST with capacity planning issues. The developed techniques are integrated in a master workforce capacity planning tool that may be independently operated by WAST planners. By means of incorporating methods that seek to simultaneously better predict future demands, recommend minimum staffing requirements and generate low-cost rosters, the tool ultimately provides planners with an analytical base to effectively deploy resources. Whilst the tool is primarily developed for WAST, the generic nature of the methods considered means they could equally be applied to any service subject to demand that is of an urgent nature, cannot be backlogged, is heavily time-dependent and highly variable.

One output is selected as objective to be minimized, while other outputs must satisfy given threshold values. Moreover, the simulation inputs must be integer and satisfy linear or nonlinear constraints. The heuristic combines (i) sequentialized experimental designs to specify the simulation input combinations, (ii) Kriging (or Gaussian process or spatial correlation modeling) to analyze the global simulation input/output data resulting from these designs, and (iii) integer nonlinear programming to estimate the optimal solution from the Kriging metamodels. The heuristic is applied to an ( s , S ) inventory system and a call-center simulation, and compared with the popular commercial heuristic OptQuest embedded in the Arena versions 11 and 12. In these two applications the novel heuristic outperforms OptQuest in terms of number of simulated input combinations and quality of the estimated optimum.

Commonly used criteria include Akaike's IC and Schwarz's Bayesian IC. They involve the sum of two terms: the model's log likelihood and a penalty for the number of model parameters. The likelihood is calculated with equal weight being given to all observations. We propose that greater weight should be put on more recent observations in order to reflect more recent accuracy. This seems particularly pertinent when selecting among exponential smoothing methods, as they are based on an exponential weighting principle. In this paper, we use exponential weighting within the calculation of the log likelihood for the IC. Our empirical analysis uses supermarket sales and call centre arrivals data. The results show that basing model selection on the new exponentially weighted IC can outperform individual models and selection based on the standard IC.

Applications of relevance include forecasting volumes of call centre arrivals, transportation, e-mail traffic and electricity loads. The first method that we develop extends an exponential smoothing formulation that has been used for daily sales data, and which involves smoothing the total weekly volume and its split across the periods of the week. Two new methods are proposed that use discount weighted regression (DWR). The first uses DWR to estimate the time-varying parameters of a model with trigonometric terms. The second introduces DWR splines. We also consider a time-varying spline that uses exponential smoothing. The final new method presented here involves the use of singular value decomposition followed by exponential smoothing. Empirical results are provided using a series of intraday call centre arrivals.

Univariate methods have been developed that model the intraweek and intraday seasonal cycles in intraday load data. Three such methods, shown to be competitive in recent empirical studies, are double seasonal ARMA, an adaptation of Holt–Winters exponential smoothing for double seasonality, and another, recently proposed, exponential smoothing method. In multiple years of load data, in addition to intraday and intraweek cycles, an intrayear seasonal cycle is also apparent. We extend the three double seasonal methods in order to accommodate the intrayear seasonal cycle. Using six years of British and French data, we show that for prediction up to a day-ahead the triple seasonal methods outperform the double seasonal methods, and also a univariate neural network approach. Further improvement in accuracy is produced by using a combination of the forecasts from two of the triple seasonal methods.

A recently proposed exponential smoothing method involves smoothing a different intraday cycle for each distinct type of day of the week. Similar days are allocated identical intraday cycles. A limitation is that the method allows only whole days to be treated as identical. We introduce a new exponential smoothing formulation that allows parts of different days of the week to be treated as identical. The result is a method that involves the smoothing and initialisation of fewer terms. We evaluate forecasting up to a day ahead using two empirical studies. For electricity load data, the new method compares well with a range of alternatives. The second study involves a series of arrivals at a call centre that is open for a shorter duration at the weekends than on weekdays. Among the variety of methods considered, the new method is the only one that can model in a satisfactory way in this situation, where the number of periods on each day of the week is not the same.

To do this we study two important queueing models, namely the infinite server queue and the multi-server queue with abandonment. We derive exact expressions for the value of many standard risk measures for the Mt/M/∞, Mt/G/∞, and Mt/Mt/∞ queueing models. We also derive Gaussian based approximations for the value of risk measures for the Erlang-A queueing model. Unlike more traditional approaches of performance analysis, risk measures offer the ability to satisfy the unique and specific risk preferences or tolerances of service operations managers. We also show how risk measures can be used for staffing nonstationary systems with different risk preferences and assess the impact of these staffing policies via simulation.

We take into account operator labor costs, caller waiting costs, and abandonment costs for lost calls. Instead of relying on the traditional method of queueing theory for call center management, we present a method that obtains expected caller waiting time and expected abandonment rate directly by introducing the inbound-load parameter. We develop a framework that combines workforce planning and operator deployment for a mixed call center in a single mathematical programming model. This paper also demonstrates how the proposed methodology can be applied in practice, with a case study based on actual operational data. Our primary conclusion is that the method presented in this research can significantly reduce both expected total cost (by 55.1% in our case study) and abandonment rate (from 15% to 2.1% in our case study). In addition, we demonstrate, using a sensitivity analysis, that our methodology will be more effective in an environment where the unit penalty cost of an abandoned call is relatively high among competitive hospitals.

There are several causes of this problem, one of which is inadequate resource allocation. In this paper, we propose using a modified version of the square root staffing (SRS) rule to satisfy the probability of delay target. We use the concepts of kinetics and biological modeling to approximate the fluid behavior of the queueing process. We are then able to estimate the offered load and the appropriate service grade necessary to construct a staffing policy that meets the target. Additionally, we show how to utilize Pontryagin’s maximum principle to find the optimal number of providers that minimizes delay and staffing costs. Finally, we demonstrate the implementation of our model using data from a hospital in upstate New York.

In this triad, franchisees use their affiliation with the franchisor's brand to attract customers to their local outlets. In exchange for the right of assuming the identity of the brand, the franchisee pays the franchisor royalties and retains residual profits. Applying Agency Theory, this paper examines the inherent conflict of interests between a principal (i.e., franchisor) that controls and manages brand equity as a shared resource and an agent (i.e., franchisee) that retains pricing right and profits from the identity of the brand by interacting directly with customers. We empirically isolate the effect of triad structure on outlet performance by matching two unique datasets. One set of data captures operational performance in the form of aggregated online review scores and the other financial performance including average daily hotel rate and revenue per available room. We find that franchisees charge higher prices than their corporate counterparts even when controlling for operational performance. Even though franchisees charge higher prices they maintain similar financial performance in terms of revenue per available room. These results suggest that the triad structure plays a significant role in franchisees’ ability to free-ride on shared brand equity and have important managerial implications for effective outsourcing, contract design and performance evaluation for a wide range of service industries.

We consider the case in which all workers can be trained on all tasks, the workforce is a resource that determines the capacity and a complete forecasting of demand is not available. The demand mix variation that the organization wants to be able to cope with is fixed by establishing a maximum time to devote to each product. We contend that this approach is straightforward, has managerial practicality and can be applied to a broad range of practical scenarios. It is required that the demand mix variation be met, even if there are a certain level of absences. To numerically solve the mathematical problem, a constraint-based selection procedure is developed, which we term CODEMI. We provide illustrated examples demonstrating solution quality for the approximation, and we report on an illustrative set of computational cases.

Examples include time-dependent call volumes and agents at inbound call centers, time-varying air traffic at airports, time-dependent truck arrival rates at seaports, and cyclic message volumes in computer systems. There are several approaches for the performance analysis of queueing systems with deterministic parameter changes over time. In this survey, we develop a classification scheme that groups these approaches according to their underlying key ideas into (i) numerical and analytical solutions, (ii) approaches based on models with piecewise constant parameters, and (iii) approaches based on modified system characteristics. Additionally, we identify links between the different approaches and provide a survey of applications that are categorized into service, road and air traffic, and IT systems.

For this system, the popular square-root staffing rule determines the necessary staffing level to achieve the desirable QED (quality-and-efficiency-driven) service regime, however, the rule also implies that properties of large systems are highly sensitive to parameters. We reveal that the origin of this high sensitivity is due to the operation of large systems at a point of singularity in a phase diagram of service regimes. We can avoid this singularity by implementing a congestion-based control (CBC) scheme—a scheme that allows the system to change its arrival and service rates under congestion. We analyze a modified Erlang A model under the CBC scheme using a Markov chain decomposition method, derive non-asymptotic and asymptotic normal representations of performance indicators, and confirm that the CBC scheme makes large systems less sensitive than the original Erlang A model.

Currently, research on boarding has focused on the beds that these patients occupy while they wait for admission in the inpatient ward. Little attention has been given to the check-ups these patients will inevitably need while waiting. These check-ups also confront the physicians with a challenging task: prioritizing between boarding patients and patients currently under treatment in the emergency department. This article firstly explores the limited previous research on boarding patients. Secondly, this paper quantitatively demonstrates that needy boarding patients can significantly impact system performance and hence should be accounted for in the analysis and planning of an emergency department through discrete-event simulation. Next, three static priority policies (first-come, first-served and always prioritizing either boarding patients or the other patients) and one dynamic priority policy (using accumulating priorities) are evaluated on various performance measures. We find, for our case study, that system performance is optimized by applying a priority policy that favours patients currently under treatment in the emergency department.

The quality of ED services, measured by waiting time and length of stay, is significantly affected by patient arrivals. Increased patient arrivals could undermine service timeliness, thus putting patients in severe conditions at risk. These factors lead to the following research questions that have rarely been studied before: What are the variables directly associated with patient arrivals in the ED? What is the nature of association between these variables and patient arrivals? Which variable is the most influential and why? To address the above questions, we proposed a three-stage method in this paper. First, a data-driven method is used to identify contributing variables directly correlated with the daily arrivals of Categories 3 and 4 patients (i.e., non-critical patients). Second, the association between contributing variables and daily patient arrival is modeled by using artificial neural network (ANN), and the modeling ability is compared with that of nonlinear least square regression (NLLSR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) in terms of mean average percentage error (MAPE). Third, four types of relative importance (RI) of input variables based on ANN are compared, and their statistical reliability is tested by the MLR-based RI. We applied this three-stage method to one year of data of patient arrivals at a local ED. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Theoretically, this paper emphasizes the importance of using data-driven selection of variables for complex system modeling, and then provides a comprehensive comparison of RI using different computational methods. Practically, this work is a novel attempt of applying ANN to model patient arrivals, and the result can be used to aid in strategic decision-making on ED resource planning in response to predictable arrival variations.

The e-retailer can purchase products directly from a manufacturer under its own brand or indirectly from a brand-name company and then deliver the products to consumers through logistics services. By comparing and analysing e-retailers’ procurement equilibrium strategies under different logistics, we find that e-retailers with different logistics systems have identical procurement preferences when the procurement cost is low or high. However, when the procurement cost is moderate, the e-retailer with third-party logistics is more motivated to adopt direct procurement. In addition, when indirect procurement has a smaller market influence, e-retailers are more inclined toward direct procurement even if the demand is more sensitive to brand-name products. Furthermore, under certain conditions, pricing rules are quite opposite between different procurement modes such that the price decreases even if the cost is more sensitive to the logistics service level in indirect procurement. Moreover, the brand-name company may set a lower resale price instead when improving quality becomes more expensive.

Prior research shows that costs respond less to decreases than increases in sales activity when firms invest in committed resources. We analyze asymmetry in cost behavior to investigate how resource procurement decisions between flexible and committed resources are related to precedent and antecedent information about demand uncertainty. We find that the asymmetry of cost responsiveness increases with historical sales growth and with the firm's market-to-book ratio, and decreases with historical sales volatility. We find similar results for firm-specific deviations of sales growth, sales volatility and the market-to-book ratio from the industry averages. These results illustrate how managers might combine precedent and antecedent information in formulating a resource procurement plan as a means of strategic cost management.

We model the impact of advertising on the required capacity and develop a forecasting model for incoming calls, where the impact of direct-response advertising is considered. With the estimation results, we forecast the number of incoming calls to the call center. Next, the forecasts are input into the capacity planning simulation module to directly simulate a service process at the highly disaggregated level. This simulation mimics the service level requirements and queue behavior and shows that the call center is operating at a high level of efficiency and performance. We illustrate that advertising may cause a temporary overload of the system and increase the number of abandoned calls, which is suboptimal for call center performance.

We develop and analyze a series of models, and we derive expressions for the optimal switching decision, the value of the option to outsource, the value of the option to backsource, and the probability and timing of switches between the alternative sources. One contribution is the models and associated derivations, which are largely new to the literature and may serve as a tool to support service sourcing plans and decisions. The second contribution is a series of results with managerial implications: (1) The probability of outsourcing is generally increasing in volatility for high-skill process and decreasing in volatility for low-skill processes. Earlier work has found that the hysteresis band is increasing in volatility, which is interpreted as an indicator of increasing organizational inertia. We also find that the hysteresis band is increasing in volatility, but interestingly for the case of high-skill processes, organizational inertia tends to be decreasing in volatility. (2) The option to backsource is generally more valuable for high-skill processes than for low-skill processes. This result suggests that investments to make it easier to backsource should have a higher priority for high-skill processes. (3) The value of the option to backsource a high-skill service process can be decreasing in volatility. The result suggests that a rather nuanced consideration of volatility is in order when considering investments in the flexibility to backsource a high-skill process.

Determining these staffing requirements is often not straightforward, particularly in systems where the arrival rate fluctuates over the day. We present a branch-and-bound approach to estimate optimal shift schedules in systems with nonstationary stochastic demand and service level constraints. The algorithm is intended for personnel planning in service systems with limited opening hours (such as small call centers, banks, and retail stores). Our computational experiments show that the algorithm is efficient in avoiding regions of the solution space that cannot contain the optimum, moreover, it requires only a limited number of evaluations to encounter the estimated optimum. The quality of the starting solution is not a decisive factor for the algorithm׳s performance. Finally, by benchmarking our algorithm against two state-of-the-art algorithms, we show that our algorithm is very competitive, as it succeeds in finding a high-quality solution fast (i.e., with a limited number of simulations required in the search phase).

Notably, we model special-day effects on an hourly rather than a daily basis. Hourly specified predictor variables are implemented in the regression model with a seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARMA) type error structure in order to efficiently reflect the special-day effects. The interaction terms between the hour-of-day effects and the hourly based special-day effects are also included to capture the unique intraday patterns of special days more accurately. The multiplicative SARMA mechanism is employed in order to identify the double seasonal cycles, namely, the intraday effect and the intraweek effect. The forecast results of the suggested model are evaluated by comparing them with those of various benchmark models for the following year. The empirical results indicate that the suggested model outperforms the benchmark models for both special- and non-special day predictions.

KPIs are frequently employed as measures of system performance in health care settings. The primary flaw with KPIs is that they represent a system of constraints with no objective function. KPIs say nothing about customers who exceed their limit, so long as such occurrences are sufficiently rare, when in fact customers who miss their time limit in a health care setting are of greater importance, not lesser. We address this flaw by minimising the mean number of customers present who have exceeded their respective limits, we consider also weighted averages of the numbers in excess for each class. We then show that one logical service discipline to achieve this goal is the Accumulating Priority Queueing (APQ) discipline. We carry out numerical examples to investigate the utility of our method. We then apply the optimisation approach to the case of an Emergency Department in Southern Ontario, Canada.

The importance of ICT is demonstrated by its accounting for 8.2% of the value added and for over 20% of employment in the OECD countries. The literature reviewed is categorised by both the ICT area of application and the modelling approach. The ICT application areas are: mobile telephony, internet usage or provision, and other ICT related products and services. The main modelling and forecasting approaches are diffusion modelling and forecasting, time series forecasting and technological forecasting, and this review devotes a section to each of these approaches. Most of the research activity in the field (measured by numbers of papers) has occurred in the modelling of diffusion in ICT, particularly mobile telephony, producing beneficial cross-fertilisation between forecasting and ICT applications, examples are multi-generational modelling and choice modelling. Although call centre manpower planning has led to innovative forecasting models, other analyses of clusters of ICT time series data sets have been less innovative. Technological forecasting papers tend to be exercises based on expert opinion.

These decisions are particularly challenging for omnichannel service centers, where customers can request services via different communication channels (e.g., phone, e-mail, live-chat, social media) that have different service quality and response requirements. We present a formulation of the omnichannel workforce management problem that accounts for variations in response urgencies of different channels as well as diminishing agent performances due to channel switching. We develop an algorithm that efficiently provides solutions for this problem and determines the number and channel allocation of service agents within the service center. Through numerical experiments, we study the performance of the algorithm among various service center configurations with equal cost characteristics. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can identify service center structures that outperform many alternative structures, including those commonly-adopted in the real-world.

Despite the controversy surrounding its performance implications, customer-support outsourcing is still on the rise, especially to emerging markets. Against this backdrop, we study under which conditions customer-support outsourcing to providers from emerging versus established economies is more versus less successful. Our performance measure is the stock-market reaction around the outsourcing announcement date. While the stock market reacts, on average, more favorably when customer-support is outsourced to providers located in emerging markets as opposed to established economies, approximately 50% of the outsourcing firms in our sample experience negative abnormal returns. We find that the shareholder-value implications of customer-support outsourcing to emerging versus established economies are contingent on the nature of the customer support that is being outsourced and on the nature of the outsourcing firm. Customer-support outsourcing to emerging markets is less beneficial for services that are characterized by personal customer contact and high knowledge embeddedness than for customer-support services that involve impersonal customer contact and are low on knowledge embeddedness. Firms higher in marketing resource intensity and larger firms benefit more from outsourcing customer-support services to emerging markets than firms lower in marketing resource intensity and smaller firms.

Customer classes have different priorities. The content of different types of calls is assumed to be similar allowing their service times to be identical. We study the problem of announcing delays to customers upon their arrival. For the simplest model without reneging, we give a method to estimate virtual delays that is used within the announcement step. For the second model, we first build the call center model incorporating reneging. The model takes into account the change in customer behavior that may occur when delay information is communicated to them. In particular, it is assumed that customer reneging is replaced by balking that depends on the state of the system in this case. We develop a method based on Markov chains in order to estimate virtual delays of new arrivals for this model. Finally, some practical issues concerning delay announcement are discussed.

Modeling our call center as a multiclass GI / GI / s + M queue, we focus on developing scheduling policies that satisfy a target ratio constraint on the abandonment probabilities of premium customers to regular ones. The problem is inspired by a real call center application in which we want to reach some predefined preference between customer classes for any workload condition. The motivation for this constraint comes from the difficulty of predicting in a quite satisfying way the workload. In such a case, the traditional routing problem formulation with differentiated service levels for different customer classes would be useless. For this new problem formulation, we propose two families of online scheduling policies: queue joining and call selection policies. The principle of our policies is that we adjust their routing rules by dynamically changing their parameters. We then evaluate the performance of these policies through a numerical study. The policies are characterized by simplicity and ease of implementation.

In this paper, we develop methods for demand forecasting of sparse, transient and erratic medical consumables. Firstly, combining statistical learning of historical data with basic linear regression, price discount estimates are proposed. To reduce sparse estimates, the transformation of historical demand data is added to the linear regression model. Secondly, some general methods are proposed to deal with demand patterns that we cannot clearly capture. Thirdly, we propose optimized model specifications to select optimal model and reduce redundant variables to avoid underfitting or overfitting. In the last, some numerical experiments are carried out based on the model we propose and some completive models in the actual demand data set. In this study, we develop the most realistic price discount response function based on the problem background, which can further improve demand forecasting performance. This paper also discusses many interesting findings and conclusions.

We solve the service provider’s investment problem under the assumption that the retailer uses the service to replenish a warehouse with storable goods. We then show that a capacity contract leads to more green transports, but not necessarily a larger investment in green transport solutions. At the same time, the optimal solution involves heavy investment in inventory at the retailer. The investment in inventory is non-decreasing in the cost benefit of the green transports, which may have a significant negative environmental impact. The implication is that a capacity contract will lead to better environmental performance than a volume contract only when the green transports’ cost benefit is within a given interval. Whether the capacity contract is the more profitable option for the service provider within this interval depends on inventory related costs and the relative environmental costs from transportation and inventory. Interestingly, owing to this, regulation that target the price of the conventional vehicles, such as a carbon tax, may lead to both an increase or a decrease in environmental performance.

Vulnerability discovery modeling (VDM) techniques were proposed to assist managers with decisions, but do not include influential variables describing the software release (SR) (e.g., code size and complexity characteristics) and security assessment profile (SAP) (e.g., security team size or skill). Consequently, they have been limited to modeling discoveries over time for SR and SAP scenarios of unique products, whose results are not readily comparable without making assumptions that equate all SR and SAP combinations under study. This article introduces a groundbreaking capability that allows forecasting expected discoveries over time for arbitrary SR and SAP combinations, thus enabling managers to better understand the effects of influential variables they control on the phenomenon. To do this, we use variables that describe arbitrary SR and SAP combinations and construct VDM extensions that parametrically scale results from a defined baseline SR and SAP to the arbitrary SR and SAP of interest. Scaling parameters are estimated using expert judgment data gathered with a novel pairwise comparison approach. These data are then used to demonstrate predictions and how multivariate VDM techniques could be used by software-makers.

To facilitate customer contacts and to reduce the corresponding operating costs, organizations resort to self-service interaction channels. However, dealing with self-service customer support platforms has been identified to be one of the most frustrating aspects of a poor customer contact experience. This paper builds on real data from contact centers of a major U.S. insurance company, covering about 10 million calls, to study transfer rate at the interactive voice-response platform. We develop an empirical model to analyze features that exert significant impact on the likelihood that a call arrived to the platform is eventually transferred to a live agent. We find evidence that caller types, specific caller intents, trying distinct channels, and payment attempts can help predicting the transfer outcome. Our study confirms the importance of a caller’s location attribute and evinces that the size and composition of the set of effective features and their directions vary substantially across different states. Our results provide managers with several actionable insights to enhance the customer contact experience. For example, our feature selection analysis enables designing personalized interactive voice-response systems based on customer-contact features. Identifying those calls expected to be transferred at any time can guide recruiting and scheduling a workforce with appropriate skill sets. In addition, the transfer rate is a key input variable for various decision making problems arising in the management of call center operations.

To achieve substantial quality improvement, managers need to obtain in-depth information from operational metrics such as first call resolution (FCR). This research incorporated rough set theory (RST) in analyzing FCR to produce decision rules. RST has been known to reduce the number of attributes and attribute values without affecting the original results. Data from a tariff (industry segment) call center in Taiwan were used in this study, and a four-step process was used to produce the final decision rules. The results were verified by a 10-fold cross-validation process against the decision rules produced without applying RST. The decision rules produced with RST are as effective as those produced without, but with reduced number of attributes and attribute values. This reduced decision rule set can help managers analyze the current operator procedures more efficiently and subsequently improve the call center efficiency. Without affecting effectiveness, the RST application reduces the needed number of attributes and attribute values to produce a more compact decision rule set, and this increased efficiency, in turn, allows managers to delve deeper into the operational factors.

One important source of this uncertainty is the call arrival rate, which is typically time-varying, stochastic, dependent across time periods and call types, and often affected by external events. The accurate modeling and forecasting of future call arrival volumes is a complicated issue which is critical for making important operational decisions, such as staffing and scheduling, in the call center. In this paper, we review the existing literature on modeling and forecasting call arrivals. We also discuss the key issues for the building of good statistical arrival models. In addition, we evaluate the forecasting accuracy of selected models in an empirical study with real-life call center data. We conclude with a summary of possible future research directions in this important field.

In the literature, call center models usually do not cover these features, while real data analysis and simulation results show ignoring them inevitably leads to inaccurate estimation of the total inbound volume. Therefore, in this paper we propose a performance model that includes both features. In our model, the total volume consists of three types of calls: (1) fresh calls (i.e., initial call attempts), (2) redials, and (3) reconnects. In practice, the total volume is used to make forecasts, while according to the simulation results, this could lead to high forecast errors, and subsequently wrong staffing decisions. However, most of the call center data sets do not have customer-identity information, which makes it difficult to identify how many calls are fresh and what fractions of the calls are redials and reconnects. Motivated by this, we propose a model to estimate the number of fresh calls, and the redial and reconnect probabilities, using real call center data that has no customer-identity information. We show that these three variables cannot be estimated simultaneously. However, it is empirically shown that if one variable is given, the other two variables can be estimated accurately with relatively small bias. We show that our estimations of redial and reconnect probabilities and the number of fresh calls are close to the real ones, both via real data analysis and simulation.

Some of the calls are re-attempts after abandonments (redials), and some are re-attempts after connected calls (reconnects). The combination of redials and reconnects has not been considered when making staffing decisions, while not distinguishing them from the total calls will inevitably lead to under- or overestimation of call volumes, which results in improper and hence costly staffing decisions. Motivated by this, in this paper we study call centers where customers can abandon, and abandoned customers may redial, and when a customer finishes his conversation with an agent, he may reconnect. We use a fluid model to derive first order approximations for the number of customers in the redial and reconnect orbits in the heavy traffic. We show that the fluid limit of such a model is the unique solution to a system of three differential equations. Furthermore, we use the fluid limit to calculate the expected total arrival rate, which is then given as an input to the Erlang A formula for the purpose of calculating the service levels and abandonment probabilities. The performance of such a procedure is validated numerically in the case of both single intervals with constant parameters and multiple intervals with time-dependent parameters. The results demonstrate that this approximation method leads to accurate estimations for the service levels and the abandonment probabilities.

With a suitably parsimonious formulation the 20,000 person model runs very effectively, and the transparency associated with simulation proves an important factor in the successful use of the model as the basis for designing a promotion box system that was implemented across the Commission in 2009. The simulation modelling incorporates many Markov-type elements, and we reflect on important lessons learned from this combined use of micro-simulation and Markov-based approaches to manpower modelling.

One of the most salient risks for buyer firms in service triads is service failure due to the service provider. Indeed such service failures may be more costly for firms due to the greater relational and operational costs that may arise from the presence of the third-party provider. Yet, neither the services literature nor extant operations literature on service triads has paid much attention to the financial consequences to the buyer firm – i.e., service risks – of such service failures in triads. To fill this gap, we investigate the financial penalty of service failures due to the service provider using the event study methodology and a sample of 146 customer information security breaches as our empirical context. Analysis of the abnormal returns reveals that service failures due to the front-end service provider lead to greater shareholder losses than such failures due to the buyer firm. This provides important new insight into the financial risks arising from outsourcing front-end services. Further, we investigate the ability of the buyer firm's employee and financial resources to temper these shareholder losses. We find that buyer firm employee productivity can moderate the greater financial penalty associated with such triadic service failures but that buyer firm leverage tends to not have such a mitigating effect. This provides new guidance for theory and practice regarding how buyer firms can position themselves to buffer the financial risks arising from service failures due to front-end service providers.

In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic optimization framework to inform recruitment decision making for a period of highly uncertain demand in a setting where all patients must be served. The first stage identifies the number of permanent positions to advertise, and the second stage determines the number of temporary workers to recruit. Our framework accounts for the uncertainty in the permanent recruitment process, stochasticity of the service delivery, and asymmetry in demand information at the times of permanent and temporary recruitment. Under a general setting of the problem, we characterize the optimal first- and second-stage decisions analytically, propose fast numerical methods for finding their values, and prove some of their monotonicity properties. A case study based on data from a geriatric ward illustrates the application of our framework, and numerical experiments provide further managerial insights.

The main trade-off is the lack of control on service quality. When multiple suppliers are operating and service requirements are allocated to one or another, differential quality level is especially being an irritant to the firm's customers. In our model, the firm uses the allocation of quantity to motivate the multiple suppliers so that the equilibrium service quality in the market equalizes over all suppliers. The buyer's customers are assured of the same consistent quality level regardless of which of the multiple suppliers their calls are routed to. We obtain optimal policies of both the buyer and the suppliers in a two-supplier market and also study an asymmetric information case.

Contractual approaches, mainly derived from Transaction Costs Economics, offer some plausible explanations for reintegration originating from outsourcing failure. These explanations are mainly related to asset specificity, poor contractual design, and deficient monitoring. The study of a real case of outsourcing interruption in industrial maintenance illustrates these different factors. However, some other determinants might complement the contractual and strategic background, namely bandwagon behavior and institutional pressure exerted by external actors. Finally, we propose an integrative framework that combines micro- and macro- levels of organizational analysis. We argue that some existing complementarities between the different theories we use here can shed some light on real organizational problems. Besides the implications for theory, our work can help managers to understand the dynamics of organizational boundaries, thus allowing them to make better choices in both outsourcing and reintegration decisions.

Differently from previous approaches, the staffing levels ensuring the desired quality of service are considered uncertain, leading to a two-stage robust integer program with right-hand-side uncertainty. We show that, in our setting, modeling the correlation of the demands in consecutive time slots is easier than in other staffing approaches. The complexity issues of a Benders type reformulation are investigated and a branch-and-cut algorithm is devised. The approach can efficiently solve real-world problems from an Italian call center and effectively support managers decisions. In fact, we show that robust shifts have very similar costs to those evaluated by the traditional (deterministic) method while ensuring a higher level of protection against uncertainty.

In this paper, we demonstrate that strategic and operational risk mitigation strategies, which neutralize the impacts of disruptions and variations, respectively, are correlated. We consider “Robustness” and “Resilience” at a strategic level to mitigate disruptions and “Reliability” at an operational level to mitigate variations. A mixed integer stochastic mathematical model is developed to simultaneously a) design a robust and resilient topology for supply networks, and b) plan a reliable flow throughout its topology. We solve the model using an example of a profit-based supply network that is constructed by relying on the assumptions that were primarily used in prior studies. A sensitivity analysis of the results from the model indicates that i) the correlation between robustness and resilience is negative, ii) the correlation between robustness and reliability is positive, and iii) the correlation between resilience and reliability is negative.

In the second case, the alternative solutions are generated sequentially during the searching process, and we may terminate the algorithm when the specified sampling budget is exhausted.

Empirical studies are performed to compare the efficiency of the proposed algorithms with other existing simulation algorithms.

In this paper, we employ an ordinal logit model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to forecast such repair time categories for automotive engines. Our study is based on a unique dataset of maintenance records from the network of 64 UK garages of BT Fleet Solutions, and we consider a large number of predictor variables, with condition, manufacturing, geographical, and calendar-related information. The application of LASSO enables the identification of relevant predictor variables for forecasting purposes. Based on the Brier score and the ranked probability score (and their skill scores), we document substantial predictive ability of our method which outperforms five benchmarks, including the method used by the company. More importantly, we demonstrate explicitly how to associate the predicted probabilities with a loss function in order to make operational decisions in garages. We find that the best choice of job scheduling does not always correspond to the predicted categories, especially when the loss function is asymmetric. We show that scheduling jobs on the basis of our method can help the company reduce loss value. Finally, we identify opportunities for further improvements in the operations of the company and for garage maintenance operations in general.

We assume an exhaustive service discipline (where servers complete their current service before leaving) and use acyclic phase-type distributions to approximate the general interarrival, service, and abandonment time distributions. The time-varying performance measures of interest are: (1) the expected number of customers in queue, (2) the variance of the number of customers in queue, (3) the expected number of abandonments, and (4) the virtual waiting time distribution of a customer arriving at an arbitrary moment in time. We refer to our model as G-RAND since it analyzes a general queue using the randomization method. A computational experiment shows that our model allows the accurate analysis of small- to medium-sized problem instances.

This creates a triadic setting in which an outsourcing provider serves end customers on behalf of its clients. While outsourcing presents an opportunity to serve customers, service providers differ in their motivation and ability to fulfill customer needs. Prior research suggests that firms with a strong customer focus have an intrinsic motivation to address customer needs. We suggest that in an outsourcing context, this intrinsic motivation does not suffice. Using a Motivation–Opportunity–Ability framework, we posit that the effect of a provider's customer focus will be moderated by a set of relational, firm, and customer characteristics that affect its ability to serve end customers. We test our conceptualization among 171 outsourcing clients from the Netherlands and then validate these results among 135 Indian outsourcing providers. The findings reveal that customer-focused providers achieve higher levels of customer need fulfillment but this effect is contingent on their ability to serve end customers. In particular, customer-focused providers more effectively fulfill customer needs when clients and providers share close relational ties, when clients also have a high level of customer focus, and when end customer needs exhibit a low degree of turbulence. In addition, we find that, in turbulent markets, equipment-related services offer greater opportunity for effective customer need fulfillment than other outsourced services.

While plenty of process mining techniques have been proposed to extract insights about the way in which activities within processes are conducted, techniques to understand resource behaviour are limited. At the same time, an understanding of resources behaviour is critical to enable intelligent and effective resource management - an important factor which can significantly impact overall process performance. The presence of detailed records kept by today's organisations, including data about who, how, what, and when various activities were carried out by resources, open up the possibility for real behaviours of resources to be studied. This paper proposes an approach to analyse one aspect of resource behaviour: the manner in which a resource prioritises his/her work. The proposed approach has been formalised, implemented, and evaluated using a number of synthetic and real datasets.

It is very difficult for small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) to satisfy their customer with quality product in reasonable price. Large firms are spending huge amount of their budget in generating technology development. To cope with this competitive market, usually, SMEs concentrate on their core expertise and outsource some non-core items or activities. The outsourcing decision (when, what, whom) is very crucial for small-scale industries. Realizing this scenario, in this article, an automated self-adaptive multi-agent system has been proposed. The proposed system will help SMEs to take an appropriate decision to mitigate the uncertainty in supply chain. The developed system exploits the “Outsourcing of operations” feature by its agents to conclude the manufacturing processes faster and reduce the idle time of certain machines with less human intervention. The communication protocol for agents has been described to give an insight of their communication. It was explained how various agents like outsourcing, material planning and supplier selection will come into action at different stages and take appropriate outsourcing decisions. Therefore, this multi-agent architecture will facilitate small scale manufacturing industries to execute their manufacturing processes and complex logistics issues efficiently. The execution of proposed architecture has been described in the simulated case study.

We solve the proposed stochastic staffing decision problem with augmented probability simulation based optimization methods. The novelty of our approach stems from the use of dependent system rates to determine optimal staffing in a constrained optimization setting for stochastic service systems. We demonstrate the implications of ignoring dependence and uncertainty in system rates on simulated data for general service systems, and illustrate the application of the proposed methodology on call center operations.

Studies investigating uncertainty of the input distributions and its implications on call center management are scarce. This study attempts to fill this gap by analyzing the call center service distribution behavior by using Bayesian parametric and semi-parametric mixture models that are capable of exhibiting non-standard behavior such as multi-modality, skewness and excess kurtosis motivated by real call center data. The study is motivated by the observation that different customer profiles might require different agent skill sets which can create additional sources of uncertainty in the behavior of service distributions. In estimating model parameters, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the Gibbs sampler and the reversible jump algorithms are presented and the implications of using such models on system performance and staffing are discussed.

This paper is motivated by work with a provider of outsourced technical support services where call volumes exhibit significant variability and uncertainty. The outsourcing contract specifies a Service Level Agreement that must be satisfied over an extended period of a week or month. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer stochastic program. Our model has two distinctive features. Firstly, we combine the server sizing and staff scheduling steps into a single optimization program. Secondly, we explicitly recognize the uncertainty in period-by-period arrival rates. We show that the stochastic formulation, in general, calculates a higher cost optimal schedule than a model which ignores variability, but that the expected cost of this schedule is lower. We conduct extensive experimentation to compare the solutions of the stochastic program with the deterministic programs, based on mean valued arrivals. We find that, in general, the stochastic model provides a significant reduction in the expected cost of operation. The stochastic model also allows the manager to make informed risk management decisions by evaluating the probability that the Service Level Agreement will be achieved.

The objective is to find a minimal-cost staffing solution while meeting a target level for the quality of service to customers. We consider a common situation in which the arrival rates are unobserved random variables for which preliminary forecasts are available in a first stage when making the initial staffing decision. In a second stage, more accurate forecasts are obtained and the staffing may have to be modified at a cost, to meet the constraints. This leads to a challenging two-stage stochastic optimization problem in which the quantities involved in the (nonlinear) constraints can only be estimated via simulation, so several independent simulations are required for each first-level scenario. We propose a solution approach that combines sample average approximation with a decomposition method. We provide numerical illustrations to show the practical efficiency of our approach. The proposed method could be adapted to several other staffing problems with uncertain demand, e.g., in retail stores, restaurants, healthcare facilities, and other types of service systems.

This study investigates the capabilities of ML models for intra-daily call center arrivals’ forecasting with respect to prediction accuracy and practicability. We analyze two datasets of an online retailer’s customer support and complaints queue comprising half-hourly observations over 174.5 weeks. We compare practically relevant ML approaches and the most commonly used time series models via cross-validation with an expanding rolling window. Our findings indicate that the random forest (RF) algorithm yields the best prediction performances. Based on these results, a methodological walk-through example of a comprehensive model selection process based on cross-validation with an expanding rolling window is provided to encourage implementation in individual practical settings.

We consider integrands that are square integrable but whose Fourier series are not necessarily absolutely convergent. For such integrands, a bound on the variance is expressed through a certain type of weighted discrepancy. We prove existence and construction results for randomly shifted lattice rules such that the variance bounds are almost O ( n − α ) , where n is the number of function evaluations and α > 1 depends on our assumptions on the convergence speed of the Fourier coefficients. These results hold for general weights, arbitrary n , and any dimension. With additional conditions on the weights, we obtain a convergence that holds uniformly in the dimension, and this provides sufficient conditions for strong tractability of the integration problem. We also show that lattice rules that satisfy these bounds are not difficult to construct explicitly and we provide numerical illustrations of the behaviour of construction algorithms.

The problem and the solution procedure are described with the help of a practical problem – assembled printed circuit boards (PCBs). Errors occurring during assembling PCBs are in general classified into three kinds, viz. machine errors, manual errors and other errors. These errors may lead to the rejection of the major portion of the production and hence result the manufacturer a huge loss. The problem is decomposed to have two objective functions, one is a sum-of-fractional objectives and the other is a non-linear objective with bounded constraints. The interest is to maximize the sum-of-fractional objectives and to minimize the non-linear objective, subject to stochastic and non-stochastic bounded environment. The first problem deals with the maximization of the profit (maximizing sum-of-fractional objectives) and the second deals with the minimization of the loss (errors), so as to obtain the maximum profit after removing the number of defective PCBs.

The fluid model can be regarded as an approximation for a stochastic queueing system with multiple customer classes and multiple server groups, with customer abandonment and non-exponential service-time and time-to-abandon distributions. The fluid model is attractive to provide a rough analysis of large systems, with high arrival rate and many servers. Even though the fluid model evolves deterministically, the service-time distributions and time-to-abandon distributions beyond their means play a critical role. The fluid model can be used for staffing, routing and system design, because it is possible to formulate tractable optimization problems.

(2015). Here we focus on forecasting future daily arrival totals and predicting hourly occupancy levels in real time, given recent history (previous arrival and departure times of all patients) and useful exogenous variables. For the arrival forecasting, we divide the dataset into an initial training set for fitting the models and a final test set to evaluate the performance. By using 200 weeks of data instead of the previous 25, we identify (i) long-term trends in both the arrival process and the length-of-stay distributions and (ii) dependence among successive daily arrival totals, which were undetectable before. From several forecasting methods, including artificial neural network models, we find that a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous (holiday and temperature) regressors (SARIMAX) time-series model is most effective. We then combine our previous ED model with the arrival prediction to create a real-time predictor for the future ED occupancy levels.

This paper investigates the methods for coordinating the call center outsourcing supply chain with financial constraint. Based on an outsourcing supply chain that is composed of a user company and a financially constrained call center, the effectiveness of three contracts (revenue sharing contract, output penalty contract and cost sharing contract) in coordinating the outsourcing supply chain is examined. Theoretical results show that the cost sharing contract can achieve channel coordination as well as improving the profit of each member firm, however, the revenue sharing contract and the output penalty contract achieve channel coordination by sacrificing the profit of the user company. Moreover, financial risk makes the output penalty contract less profitable than the other two contracts under some conditions. Numerical results are further presented to reveal the managerial insights.

Thus, this paper studies when the optimal time to outsource is, by proposing a real option model. The timing strategy takes into account a firm’s effort at the preparation stage and an outsourced proportion, because ex post future profits and consequently the optimal time are affected by how well prepared the outsourcing is and how large proportions a firm outsources. Based on the model, this research provides managerial implications about how outsourcing timing strategies should vary when outsourcing environments such as market uncertainty changes and a firm’s effort. Our model shows that a firm can outsource earlier when an investment (effort) at the preparation stage is more efficiently made, when market becomes more stable, when it can expect higher marginal profits from the outsourcing, when it can outsource more proportion. Also, by comparing a widely used net present value model to our real option model, we show that the traditional method underestimates a firm’s value for outsourcing and misleads a firm to outsource earlier. Finally, we provide a descriptive framework for a decision support system.

Our model assumes that the service for each quantum of fluid consists of a sequence of two stages, the first stage for the conversation with a customer and the second stage for the ACW. When the duration of each stage has exponential, hyperexponential or hypo-exponential distribution, we derive the time-dependent behavior of the content of fluid in each stage of service as well as that in the waiting room. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate the system performance for the cases in which the input rate and/or the number of servers vary in sinusoidal fashion as well as in adaptive ways and in stationary cases.

The resulting queue with delay announcement is modeled in a stationary setting. We propose a fluid approximation to estimate the possibility of announcing the mean delay distribution and the retrials in the system. This approximation method can overcome some of the computational issues involved with a continuous time Markov chain analysis. The fluid approximation is also validated that it can work well in overloaded systems by performing a comparison between the fluid model and the stochastic model with delay information, and by performing the other comparison between the fluid model and the simulation model. Through a numerical study, this paper demonstrates the significance of delay information in a call center with retrials. In particular, delay announcement is more important in the system with a high retrial probability. Thus, we show how a delay announcement greatly reduces customer reneging and thereby improves customer satisfaction. It is shown that disregarding retrials in call centers with delay information may result in large distortions in the management of call centers.

The market we study consists of multiple competing call centers and many clients searching for outsourcing partners to answer their customers’ phone calls. Through the perspective of operational efficiency, we create a single index that aggregates several contract parameters. The index can be used to segment the call center market as well as to estimate the contract prices at equilibrium. The results can help the call centers to locate and focus on their market niches. Clients can use the results to estimate the cost of their contracts and negotiate with the call centers for better deals. The results can also be used to explain the observed reshoring phenomenon in recent years from the perspective of operations management. In particular, our results suggest that call centers in low-wage locations have a competitive advantage on large contracts with very strict waiting time requirements. On the other hand, call centers in high-wage locations may still be attractive for contracts that have lower call volumes, shorter contract lengths, and/or less strict waiting time requirements. Finally, we present field studies from an international service provider with call centers in multiple locations. The results of the field studies suggest a strong match between our theoretical results and the empirical evidence.

The SSP is often difficult to solve to optimality in practice for its complex structure. In this paper, a two-stage approach is proposed to tackle the problem, where the former generates preliminary solutions satisfying all the hard constraints, and the latter refines the solutions by fulfilling soft constraints as much as possible. The proposed approach employs artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm as the main search framework in both stages, and appropriate neighborhood structures are designed respectively. Specifically, in the latter stage, integer programming (IP) employed under several ruin-and-recreate principles is embedded in the ABC algorithm, which helps intensify and diversify solutions. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in achieving good solutions for large-scale problem instances. In addition, we give some guidance on how to weigh various employees’ working preferences and how to balance labor costs and staff satisfaction. Finally, a case study is given to explain how the proposed model and algorithm work for a call center. This study will help call centers make appropriate decisions when planning their employees.

To provide a flexible model that can be readily fit to system data, the model has Bernoulli routing, where the feedback probabilities, service-time, patience-time and feedback-delay distributions all are general and may depend on the visit number. Simulation experiments confirm that the new MOL approximations are effective. A many-server heavy-traffic FWLLN shows that the performance targets are achieved asymptotically as the scale increases.

The integrated problem is formulated into a bi-level program. The planning problem is solved in the upper level, while the scheduling problems in the planning periods are solved under uncertainties in the lower level. The planning and scheduling problems are linked via service level constraints. To solve the integrated problem, a hybrid method is developed, which iterates between a mixed-integer linear programming solver for the planning problem and an agent-based reactive scheduling method. If the service level constraints are not met, a cutting plane constraint is generated by the agent-based scheduling method and appended to the planning problem which is solved to determine new production quantities. The hybrid method returns an optimality gap for validating the solution quality. The proposed method is demonstrated by two complicated problems which are solved efficiently with small gaps less than 1%.

We study the optimal decisions of a price-taking and a price-setting newsvendor when the advertisers have private information about their willingness to pay. We focus on the impact of the number of advertisers on the newsvendor’s optimal decisions. We find that regardless of the number of advertisers, the newsvendor may exclude advertisers with a low willingness to pay and distort the price and inventory from their system-efficient levels to screen the advertisers. Moreover, the newsvendor’s decision to exclude an advertiser is based exclusively on that advertiser’s characteristics, and the newsvendor’s optimal decision thus reveals independence among the advertisers. Nonetheless, the profits of the newsvendor and the advertisers also display network effects as both increase in the number of advertisers. Finally, our numerical results show that the newsvendor prefers an equivalent single advertiser to multiple advertisers due to the pooling effect.

In general, solving chance constrained optimization problems is challenging and the existing methods for solving a chance constrained optimization problem largely rely on solving an approximation problem. Among the various approximation methods, robust optimization can provide safe and tractable analytical approximation. In this paper, we address the question of what is the optimal (least conservative) robust optimization approximation for the chance constrained optimization problems. A novel algorithm is proposed to find the smallest possible uncertainty set size that leads to the optimal robust optimization approximation. The proposed method first identifies the maximum set size that leads to feasible robust optimization problems and then identifies the best set size that leads to the desired probability of constraint satisfaction. Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a portfolio optimization problem, a production planning and a process scheduling problem.

Scenario reduction aims at selecting a small number of scenarios to represent a large set of scenarios for decision making, so as to significantly reduce the computational complexity while preserving the solution quality of using a large number of scenarios. In this work, a new computationally efficient scenario reduction algorithm is proposed based on transportation distance minimization. The proposed algorithm relies on solving linear programming problems. The scenario subset updating step and the probability value assignment step are performed in an iterative manner until the transportation distance converges. Comparison with existing scenario reduction methods reveals that the proposed method is very efficient for the reduction of large scenario set. Application studies on stochastic optimization problems also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Popular end-to-end approaches tend to capture spurious correlations in historical data, whereas two-stage approaches that decompose time series and make separate predictions often result in error accumulation. To address these issues, we propose PoissonGP, a novel Bayesian model that employs a non-homogeneous Poisson process with a Gaussian process prior for sales prediction. PoissonGP can capture complex patterns in data with multiple trends and manage distribution shifts caused by changes in long-run sales. Additionally, it incorporates forecast uncertainty and provides interpretability for building efficient and visual decision support systems. Experimental results on several synthetic and empirical datasets suggest that PoissonGP outperforms existing approaches, making it a promising tool for e-commerce platforms.

These features are accessible via the software's user interface. In order to identify the best-fitting model for a time series, the user needs to go through trial and error. Manually operating the pull-down menus of SPSS Statistics is time-consuming and tedious. Therefore, this paper presents an automated time series modeling and forecasting approach based on the integration plug-in for python in SPSS Statistics, enabling non-professionals to use it for data analysis. Our approach is evaluated on a real-world time series dataset. The results reveal that we can get a satisfactory model outperforming the Expert Modeler provided by SPSS Statistics, and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) on the test data is reduced by about 18.8%. Moreover, we can also get 110 models with better goodness of fit and forecasting performance.

In this paper, we analyze a simple two dimensional Markov chain model of a queueing system in which multiple servers can arrive to increase service capacity, and depart if a server has been idle for too long. It is well known that multi-dimensional Markov chains are in general difficult to analyze. Our focus is on an approximation method of stationary performance of the system via the Stein method. For this purpose, innovative methods are developed to estimate the moments of the Markov chain, as well as the solution to the Poisson equation with a partial differential operator.

Technological progress allows business process service providers (BPSPs) to offer a wide range of digitized and standardized services to business clients. Within this business model, capacity planning is a major challenge for BPSPs, as costs are the decisive factor in the competitive business environment of digital service provision. Accordingly, BPSPs must tackle inefficiencies in capacity planning resulting from both idle capacity and lost revenue caused by volatile demand. However, recent technological developments offering dynamic integration and information capabilities may help, as they enable the exchange of excess capacity between business partners. We examine the corresponding potential of IT-enabled excess capacity markets to create competitive advantage in e-business value chains by analyzing a BPSP's capacity-related optimization problem. We build an analytical model based on queuing theory and evaluate it through a discreteevent simulation applying a possible application scenario. By solving the optimization problem, we identified a remarkable cost advantage in using excess capacity as a first competitive advantage. Building on this cost advantage, we furthermore identified differentiation advantages realizable without raising prices. Both findings highlight the relevance of further research on this topic."

Thanks to improved network connectivity, it becomes a promising enabling solution to offload computation-intensive applications to the resource abundant public cloud to further augment the capacity of resource-constrained devices. As mobile applications usually have QoS requirements, it is critical to provide low latency services to the mobile users while maintain low leasing cost of cloud resources. However, the resources offered by cloud vendors are usually charged based on a time quanta while the offloading demand for heavy-lifting computation may occur infrequently on mobile devices. This mismatch would demotivate users to resort to public cloud for computation offloading. In this paper, we design a computation offloading middleware which bridges the aforementioned gap between cloud vendors and mobile clients, providing offloading service to multiple users with low cost and delay. The proposed middleware has two key components: Task Scheduler and Instance Manager. The Task Scheduler dispatches the received offloading tasks to execute in the instances reserved by the Instance Manager. Based on the arrival pattern of offloading tasks, the Instance Manager dynamically changes the number of instances to ensure certain service grade of mobile users. Our proposed mechanisms are validated through numerical results. It is shown that a lower average delay can be achieved through proposed scheduling heuristic, and the number of reserved instances well adapts to the offloading demands.

We develop R-SPLINE---a Retrospective-search algorithm that alternates between a continuous Search using Piecewise-Linear Interpolation and a discrete Neighborhood Enumeration, to asymptotically identify a local minimum. R-SPLINE appears to be among the first few gradient-based search algorithms tailored for solving integer-ordered local SO problems. In addition to proving the almost-sure convergence of R-SPLINE’s iterates to the set of local minima, we demonstrate that the probability of R-SPLINE returning a solution outside the set of true local minima decays exponentially in a certain precise sense. R-SPLINE, with no parameter tuning, compares favorably with popular existing algorithms.

Examples include check-in lines at airports, waiting rooms in hospitals, queues in contact centers, data buffers in wireless networks, and delayed service in cloud data centers. These are all situations with jobs (clients, patients, tasks) and servers (agents, beds, processors) that have large capacity levels, ranging from the order of tens (checkouts) to thousands (processors). This survey investigates how to design such systems to exploit resource pooling and economies-of-scale. In particular, we review the mathematics behind the quality- and efficiency-driven (QED) regime, which lets the system operate close to full utilization, while the number of servers grows simultaneously large and delays remain manageable. Aimed at a broad audience, we describe in detail the mathematical concepts for the basic Markovian many-server system, and we provide only sketches or references for more advanced settings related to, e.g., load balancing, overdispersion, parameter uncertainty, general service requirements, and queueing networks.

Although the transient solutions of corresponding continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) are more precise than methods using stationary approximations, most authors consider their computational costs prohibitive for practical application. This article presents a new variant of the uniformization algorithm that utilizes a modified steady-state detection technique. The presented algorithm is applicable for CTMCs when their stationary solution can be efficiently calculated in advance, particularly for many practically applicable birth-and-death models with limited size. It significantly improves computational efficiency due to an early prediction of an occurrence of a steady state, using the properties of the convergence function of the embedded discrete-time Markov chain. Moreover, in the case of an inhomogeneous CTMC solved in consecutive timesteps, the modification guarantees that the error of the computed probability distribution vector is strictly bounded at each point of the considered time interval.

SRFPs are equivalently expressed as stochastic fixed-point problems, where the underlying function is expressed implicitly via a noisy simulation. After motivating SRFPs using a few examples, we review available methods to solve such problems on constrained Euclidean spaces. We present the current literature as three broad categories, and detail the basic theoretical results that are currently known in each of the categories. With a view towards helping the practitioner, we discuss specific variations in their implementable form, and provide references to computer code when easily available. Finally, we list a few questions that are worthwhile research pursuits from the standpoint of advancing our knowledge of the theoretical underpinnings and the implementation aspects of solutions to SRFPs.

Examples include stochastic adaptations of fixed-point and gradient descent recursions obtained by replacing function and derivative values appearing within the recursion by their Monte Carlo counterparts. The primary motivating settings are simulation optimization and stochastic root finding problems, where the low point and the zero of a function are sought, respectively, with only Monte Carlo estimates of the functions appearing within the problem. We ask how much Monte Carlo sampling needs to be performed within simulation-based recursions in order that the resulting iterates remain consistent and, more importantly, efficient, where “efficient” implies convergence at the fastest possible rate. Answering these questions involves trading off two types of error inherent in the iterates: the deterministic error due to recursion and the “stochastic” error due to sampling. As we demonstrate through a characterization of the relationship between sample sizing and convergence rates, efficiency and consistency are intimately coupled with the speed of the underlying recursion, with faster recursions yielding a wider regime of “optimal” sampling rates. The implications of our results for practical implementation are immediate since they provide specific guidance on optimal simulation expenditure within a variety of stochastic recursions.

It spans the full spectrum of operational, clinical, and financial perspectives, over varying horizons: operational—a few hours or days ahead, tactical—weeks or a few months ahead, and strategic, which involves planning on monthly and yearly scales. Simulation offers a natural framework within which to address these challenges, as realistic ED models are typically intractable analytically. We apply a general and flexible ED simulator to address several significant problems that arose in a large Israeli hospital. The article focuses mainly, but not exclusively, on workforce staffing problems over these time horizons. First, we demonstrate that our simulation model can support real-time control, which enables short-term prediction and operational planning (physician and nurse staffing) for several hours or days ahead. To this end, we present a novel simulation-based technique that implements the concept of offered-load and discover that it performs better than a common alternative. Then we evaluate ED staff scheduling that adjusts for midterm changes (tactical horizon, several weeks or months ahead). Finally, we analyze the design and staffing problems that arose from physical relocation of the ED (strategic yearly horizon). Application of the simulation-based approach led to the implementation of our design and staffing recommendations.

For such compact representations, analysis methods based on vector-Kronecker product multiplication need to be employed. When the factors in the Kronecker product terms are relatively dense, vector-Kronecker product multiplication can be performed efficiently by the shuffle algorithm. When the factors are relatively sparse, it may be more efficient to obtain nonzero elements of the generator matrix in Kronecker form on the fly and multiply them with corresponding elements of the vector. This work proposes a modification to the shuffle algorithm that multiplies relevant elements of the vector with submatrices of factors in which zero rows and columns are omitted. This approach avoids unnecessary floating-point operations that evaluate to zero during the course of the multiplication and possibly reduces the amount of memory used. Numerical experiments on a large number of models indicate that in many cases the modified shuffle algorithm performs a smaller number of floating-point operations than the shuffle algorithm and the algorithm that generates nonzeros on the fly, sometimes with a minimum number of floating-point operations and as little of memory possible.

This fluid model approximates the associated queueing system when the arrival rate and number of servers are both large. We also show that the system dynamics greatly simplifies in two special cases: (i) when the service time distribution is exponential (M) and (ii) when the service time distribution is deterministic (D) and the model is stationary. We develop an efficient algorithm to compute all standard performance functions in both cases. In case (i), we establish an asymptotic loss of memory (ALOM) property, i.e., asymptotic independence from the initial conditions as time evolves. We show that the difference in the performance functions with different initial conditions dissipates over time exponentially fast, under regularity conditions. In contrast, in case (ii) we show that ALOM fails dramatically. Instead, although all model parameters are constants, we show that the performance rapidly approaches a periodic steady state (PSS) with a period equal to the service time, whenever the system does not start with the unique stationary distribution. Moreover, the form of the PSS depends on the initial condition. Simulation and a heavy-traffic limit confirm that this anomalous behavior also occurs in the large-scale queueing model.

We then propose several classes of algorithms to approximate the optimal solution. The proposed algorithms are evaluated by extensive experiments using real-world parameters. The results show that the proposed Ordered and Genetic algorithms are computationally efficient, nearly cost-optimal, and highly robust to dynamic changes.

A prevalent one is the ability of humans to abandon their wait, for example while waiting to be answered by a telephone agent, waiting for a physician’s checkup at an emergency department, or waiting for the completion of an internet transaction. Abandonments can be very costly, to either the service provider (a forgone profit) or the customer (deteriorating health after leaving without being seen by a doctor), and often to both. Practically, models that ignore abandonment can lead to either over- or under-staffing, and in well-balanced systems (e.g., well-managed telephone call centers), the “fittest (needy) who survive” and reach service are rewarded with surprisingly short delays. Theoretically, the phenomenon of abandonment is interesting and challenging, in the context of Queueing Theory and Science as well as beyond (e.g., Psychology). Last, but not least, queueing models with abandonment are more robust and numerically stable, when compared against their abandonment-ignorant analogues. For our relatively narrow purpose here, abandonment of customers, while queueing for service, is the operational manifestation of customer patience, perhaps impatience, or (im)patience for short. This (im)patience is the focus of the present paper. It is characterized via the distribution of the time that a customer is willing to wait, and its dynamics are characterized by the hazard-rate of that distribution. We start with a framework for comprehending impatience, distinguishing the times that a customer expects to wait, is required to wait (offered wait), is willing to wait (patience time), actually waits and felt waiting. We describe statistical methods that are used to infer the (im)patience time and offered wait distributions. Then some useful queueing models, as well as their asymptotic approximations, are discussed. In the main part of the paper, we discuss several “data-based pictures” of impatience. Each “picture” is associated with an important phenomenon. Some theoretical and practical problems that arise from these phenomena, and existing models and methodologies that address these problems, are outlined. The problems discussed cover statistical estimation of impatience, behavior of overloaded systems, dependence between patience and service time, and validation of queueing models. We also illustrate how impatience changes across customers (e.g., VIP vs. regular customers), during waiting (e.g., in response to announcements) and through phases of service (e.g., after experiencing the answering machine over the phone). Our empirical analysis draws data from repositories at the Technion SEELab, and it utilizes SEEStat—its online Exploratory Data Analysis environment. SEEStat and most of our data are internet-accessible, which enables reproducibility of our research.

In this regime, which was first formalized by Halfin and Whitt, the number of servers N is not small, servers' utilization is (Efficiency-Driven) while waiting time is (Quality-Driven). This is equivalent to having the number of servers N being approximately equal to , where R is the offered load and β is a positive constant. For the G/DK/N queue in the QED regime, we analyze the virtual waiting time VN(t), as N increases indefinitely. Assuming that the service-time distribution has a finite support (hence the DK in G/DK/N), it is shown that, in the limit, the scaled virtual waiting time is representable as a supremum over a random weighted tree (S denotes a service time). Informally, it is then argued that, for large N, here is the averaging of over S, and the process is zero-mean Gaussian that summarizes all relevant information about arrivals and service times ( arises as a limit of an infinite-server (G/DK/∞) process, appropriately scaled). The results are obtained by using both combinatorial and probabilistic arguments. Possible applications of our approximations include fast simulation of queues and estimation/prediction of customer waiting times in the QED regime.

A call center is modelled as an M/M/n + G queue, which is characterized by Poisson arrivals, exponential service times, n servers, and generally distributed patience times of customers. Our asymptotic analysis is performed as the arrival rate, and hence the number of servers n, increases indefinitely. We consider a constraint satisfaction problem, where one chooses the minimal staffing level n that adheres to a given cost constraint. The cost can incorporate the fraction abandoning, average wait, and tail probabilities of wait. Depending on the cost, several operational regimes arise as asymptotically optimal: Efficiency-Driven (ED), Quality and Efficiency-Driven (QED), and also a new ED + QED operational regime that enables QED tuning of the ED regime. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, over a wide range of system parameters, our approximations provide useful insight as well as excellent fit to exact optimal solutions. It turns out that the QED regime is preferable either for small-to-moderate call centers or for large call centers with relatively tight performance constraints. The other two regimes are more appropriate for large call centers with loose constraints. We consider two versions of the constraint satisfaction problem. The first one is constraint satisfaction on a single time interval, say one hour, which is common in practice. Of special interest is a constraint on the tail probability, in which case our new ED + QED staffing turns out asymptotically optimal. We also address a global constraint problem, say over a full day. Here several time intervals, say 24 hours, are considered, with interval-dependent staffing levels allowed, one seeks to minimize staffing levels, or more generally costs, given the overall performance constraint. In this case, there is the added flexibility of trading service levels among time intervals, but we demonstrate that only little gain is associated with this flexibility if one is concerned with the fraction abandoning.

The course was “born” about 15 years ago as a graduate seminar and ultimately took its present form as a core course for the undergraduate program in industrial engineering and management. The role of measurements and data as teaching-enhancers and research-drivers is underscored. In addition, we emphasize that data granularity must reach the individual-transaction level. We describe customized databases and software tools that facilitate operational and statistical analysis of services, this includes the use of SEEStat, a data-user interface that was developed at the Technion's SEE Laboratory, for research and educational purposes. Some unique aspects of the course are the incorporation of state-of-the-art research and real-world data in lectures, recitations, and home assignments, as amply presented throughout this work. The application focus of the surveyed course has been telephone call centers, which constitute an explosively growing branch of the service industry. The course is now expanding to also cover healthcare, especially hospitals, some examples from other service areas (e.g., the justice system) are described as well.

Therefore, in order to fill this gap, we present a Bayesian methodology to identify the order of DSAR models. Assuming the model errors are normally distributed and using three priors, i.e. natural conjugate, g, and Jeffreys’ priors, on the model parameters, we derive the joint posterior mass function of the model order in a closed-form. Accordingly, the posterior mass function can be investigated and the best order of DSAR model is chosen as a value with the highest posterior probability for the time series being analyzed. We evaluate the proposed Bayesian methodology using simulation study, and we then apply it to real-world hourly internet amount of traffic dataset.

In the Bayesian framework, most of the work in this direction is only at the level of double seasonality. Therefore, in this paper we have the objective to fill part of this gap by extending autoregressive models to fit time series that have three layers of seasonality, i.e., triple seasonal autoregressive (TSAR) models, and introducing the Bayesian estimation for these models using the Gibbs sampling algorithm. In order to achieve this objective, we first assume the model errors are normally distributed and employ the normal-gamma and g priors for the model parameters. We then derive the full conditional posterior distributions to be multivariate normal for the model coefficients and inverse gamma for the model variance. Using these closed-form conditional posterior distributions, we propose the Gibbs sampling algorithm to approximate empirically the joint posterior of the TSAR model parameters, enabling us easily to carry out the Bayesian estimation of TSAR models. By employing the g prior for the model parameters, we execute an extensive simulation study to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed Bayesian estimation of TSAR models, and we then apply our work to real-world hourly electricity load time series datasets in six European countries.

The manufacturers compete for the quality of the product and sell through a common retailer with different retail prices. The demand at the market place is dependent on both the retail price and product quality. A centralized model is developed as the benchmark case. A Stackelberg structure is assumed, where the retailer is the leader who decides the retail prices of different brands of the product produced by the manufacturers, and the manufacturers are follower who set the product quality under Cournot and Collusion policies. A special case is considered where these retail prices are the same. We compare the optimal results under two different policies, each with two pricing strategies (same and different). A numerical example demonstrates the developed models and shows that the same pricing strategy is the worst one from the supply chain’s point of view while different pricing strategy is occasionally gainful from consumer’s point of view.

The call arrival process can be an arbitrary point process, allowing uncertainty and temporary surges in the arrival rate, provided that the system is stable. When a customer arrives, the call center manager examines the system state and decides whether to offer the incoming customer the callback option. When the callback option is offered, the customer decides whether to accept the offer. The customer is routed to the offline queue (to be called back later) only if he is offered the callback option and accepts it. Otherwise, he is routed to the online queue. For each customer in the online queue, the call center manager incurs a waiting cost of h per time unit. Similarly, whenever she routes a customer to the offline queue (for a callback later), she incurs a one-time penalty of p. Initially, we allow complete foresight policies that look into the entire future. We show that a simple lookahead policy that looks into the future arrivals and service completion times for the next p/h time units and uses the current number of customers in the system who previously rejected a callback offer (but does not look into the accept/reject decisions of future customers) is pathwise optimal. Building on the insights gleaned from the optimal lookahead policies, we also propose a nonanticipating (and implementable) policy by interpreting the lookahead policy in the fluid model and show that it is optimal in the fluid model. In particular, we show that this policy reduces to the so-called line policy, if the arrival rate process follows a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process. Last, we conduct a simulation study, which shows that the proposed policies perform well.

We reveal new insights on the value of contract type (price-only versus complex), demand information (complete versus asymmetric), and contract sequence (first mover versus second mover) to different players. Our results for the basic model show the following: (1) Complex contracts increase the suppliers' aggregate profit, however, individual suppliers do not necessarily benefit from a complex contracting equilibrium. We identify the conditions under which each supplier benefits from such an equilibrium. (2) Eliminating information asymmetry is not always beneficial for the suppliers because obtaining information might bring only marginal value and hence might not be realistically justified. Furthermore, a downstream supplier might prefer information asymmetry to complete information, especially when demand variability is moderate. (3) Unless there is a high demand risk, the first-mover advantage is prevalent when the assembler is a price-taker. We extend our basic model to analyze two additional scenarios. First, we study cases where the suppliers may offer contracts of different complexity. Beyond enriching our understanding of contract choice in decentralized assembly systems, such variations enhance the analysis beyond the standard methodology of principal-agent models and utilize solution techniques from optimal control. Second, we analyze the situation where the suppliers may possess different levels of information on demand under complex contracts. We show that an upstream supplier always benefits from a downstream supplier's superior information. However, the additional information might decrease the downstream supplier's profit, especially when the forecast variability is low compared to the total demand variability in the system. Our results for the basic model and its extensions confirm that studying interactions between suppliers, specifically under different contract types and information structures, in assembly systems presents rich opportunities for future research.

When the producers cannot meet the desired service level requirement of the external customers at the offered price on their own, they participate in a cooperative network. The network consolidates the external customers for its members and routes an arriving external customer to one of the participants. We determine the optimal production and rationing policies for each participating manufacturer as well as the optimal routing policy for the network. We also propose an accurate approximate method to analyse a network with a high number of homogeneous producers using a single queue approximation method. We show that, based on the parameters of the producers and the external market, the network can provide the desired service level for the external customers at the offered price and makes all the members increase their profit by better utilising their capacity and serving more external customers.

Using a Markov decision process approach, we prove that the optimal routing policy of jobs to service is a threshold policy that depends on the queue length. When the number of waiting jobs in the queue is below a certain threshold, only one server should work and the other one remains idle. At or above this threshold, both servers should serve jobs. This is an extension of the known result where only the heterogeneity in speed is considered.

We study a general non-stationary model where calls arrive according to a non-homogeneous Poisson process. The optimization problem consists in maximizing the throughput of emails under a constraint on the waiting time of inbound calls. An efficient adaptive threshold policy is proposed that is easy to implement in the automatic call distributor. This scheduling policy is evaluated through a comparison with the optimal performance measures found in the case of a constant arrival rate and also with other intuitive adaptive threshold policies in the general non-stationary case.

For maximizing the call center’s revenue, the call center manager exercises two levels of control: agent reservation for inbound calls and call outsourcing. Given the influence of waits on purchase probability, we investigate the strategy of outsourcing customers who have waited already as opposed to outsourcing customers directly at arrival. Academic/practical relevance: The main novelty of this article arises from the use of a single framework to investigate both the combination of agent reservation with outsourcing decisions, and a waiting time–based outsourcing strategy. The existing literature only considers these two strategies in isolation and is restricted to quantity-based decisions. From a practical viewpoint, our results aim to provide decision support tools that are directly implementable in a call center’s routing software. Methodology: We apply a Markov decision process approach to optimize the manager’s decisions. The particularity of our approach is that we use the experienced waiting time as a decision variable. Results: We prove that the optimal policy for reservation and outsourcing is of threshold type. Our main conclusion is that outsourcing customers after letting them wait in-house generates higher revenue than outsourcing calls at arrival. However, it is also detrimental to service quality. In addition, we identify contexts in which the difference between the two outsourcing strategies is significant. Managerial implications: Contrary to standard call center practices, which either consist of specialized teams for one type of call or only exercise one specific level of decision-making (reservation or outsourcing), we demonstrate the potential of partial outsourcing with partial reservation. Our study shows that the benefits of implementing our results are greatest in small congested call centers.

A customer at the head of the queue whose elapsed waiting time achieves a given threshold receives a voice message mentioning the option to be called back later. This callback option differs from the traditional ones found in the literature where the callback offer is given at customer’s arrival. We approximate this system by a two-dimensional Markov chain, with one dimension being a unit of a discretization of the waiting time. We next show that this approximation model converges to the exact one. This allows us to obtain explicitly the performance measures without abandonment and to compute them numerically otherwise. From the performance analysis, we derive a series of practical insights and recommendations for a clever use of the callback offer. In particular, we show that this time-based offer outperforms traditional ones when considering the waiting time of inbound calls.

A chance constraint models system’s reliability requirement that the reactor is operating at a high utilization rate given uncertain biomass moisture content, particle size distribution, and equipment failure. The model identifies operating conditions of equipment and inventory level to maintain a continuous flow of biomass to the reactor. The sample average approximation method approximates the chance constraint and a bisection search-based heuristic solves this approximation. A case study is developed using real-life data collected at Idaho National Laboratory’s biomass processing facility. An extensive computational analysis indicates that sequencing of biomass bales based on moisture level, increasing storage capacity, and managing particle size distribution, increases utilization of the reactor and reduces operational costs.

This chapter underlines the characteristics of the digital distribution typical of banking 5.0. Digital development is something that has an impact on various aspects of customers’ experiences and organizations. Banking 5.0 needs to adapt to customers’ new and increasingly demanding needs (such as e-commerce). Traditional financial institutions have considered few types of accesses. Banking 5.0 requires the organization to have a multiaccess strategy, always considering the possibility of direct contact with the end customers. Online accesses, websites, embedded banking, and mobile apps seem attractive to banking 5.0 customers. In this multiaccess strategy, the omnichannel approach is essential since it is critical to allow the customers to change accesses, get the same image, and reuse data already inserted.

Thereby, industrial companies face increasingly volatile demand that complicates an appropriate production capacity planning. On the other hand, the comprehensive digitalization of production environments favors, amongst others, the dynamic integration of flexible external on-demand production capacity provided by specialized external capacity providers (ECPs). To enable the usage of on-demand production capacity, industrial companies may require significant upfront investments (e.g., for inter-organizational information systems, planning and organizational processes, employee training). The objective of this paper is to develop a model that evaluates such enabling upfront investments from the perspective of a manufacturing company. To consider flexibility of action, we apply real options analysis in a discrete-time binomial tree model and weigh these so-called expansion options to related cash outflows. In addition, we evaluate our model by means of a simulation and sensitivity analyses and derive insights for both researchers and practitioners. The insights gained by our model present a profound economic basis for investment decisions on upfront investments in flexible on-demand production capacity.

Meanwhile, to meet the needs that some tasks in the call center require the prediction of call traffic in different time buckets for a future long term, it is necessary to forecast the call traffic in a long-term and multi-step way. However, existing forecasting methods cannot solve this problem as (1) Most existing methods merely focus on short-term forecasting for the next hour or the next day. (2) The temporal features of call traffic are ignored, which leads to a lower accuracy in long-term forecasting. Hence, in this paper, we propose a holistic solution for forecasting long-term multi-step ahead call traffic. In our method, we give a categorized way for temporal features by studying the call traffic data. After data preprocessing, we develop an extraction method for temporal features extraction for training the forecasting model. We propose two forecasting strategies based on taking different types of features as input. Experimental results on the real-world call traffic dataset show the effectiveness of our solution, including data preprocessing, temporal features mining, and the forecasting model.

Academic/practical relevance: Since algorithms are widely adopted by businesses and often require human involvement, understanding how humans perceive algorithms is instrumental to the success of algorithm design in operations. Particularly, the growing concern that algorithms may reproduce inequality historically exhibited by humans calls for research about how people perceive the fairness of algorithmic decision making (relative to traditional human-based decision making) and, consequently, adjust their work behaviors. Methodology: In a 15-day-long field experiment with Alibaba Group in a warehouse where workers pick products following orders (or “pick lists”), we randomly assigned half of the workers to receive pick lists from a machine that ostensibly relied on an algorithm to distribute pick lists, and the other half to receive pick lists from a human distributor. Results: Despite that we used the same underlying rule to assign pick lists in both groups, workers perceive the algorithmic (versus human-based) assignment process as fairer by 0.94–1.02 standard deviations. This yields productivity benefits: receiving tasks from an algorithm (versus a human) increases workers’ picking efficiency by 15.56%–17.86%. These findings persist beyond the first day when workers were involved in the experiment, suggesting that our results are not limited to the initial phrase when workers might find algorithmic assignment novel. We replicate the main results in another field experiment involving a nonoverlapping sample of warehouse workers. We also show via online experiments that people in the United States also view algorithmic task assignment as fairer than human-based task assignment. Managerial implications: We demonstrate that algorithms can have broader impacts beyond offering greater efficiency and accuracy than humans: introducing algorithmic assignment processes may enhance fairness perceptions and productivity. This insight can be utilized by managers and algorithm designers to better design and implement algorithm-based decision making in operations.

Following standard practice, the day is divided into time periods of equal length (e.g., 15 or 30 minutes), the arrival rate is assumed random but constant in time in each period, and the arrivals are from a Poisson process, conditional on the rate. The random rate for each period is taken as a deterministic base rate (or expected rate) multiplied by a random busyness factor having mean 1. Models in which the busyness factors are independent across periods, or in which a common busyness factor applies to all periods, have been studied previously. But they are not sufficiently realistic. We examine alternative models for which the busyness factors have some form of dependence across periods. Maximum likelihood parameter estimation for these models is not easy, mainly because the arrival rates themselves are never observed. We develop specialized techniques to perform this estimation. We compare the goodness-of-fit of these models on arrival data from three call centers, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Our models can represent arrivals in many other types of systems as well. Estimating a model for the vector of counts (the number of arrivals in each period) is generally easier than for the vector of rates, because the counts can be observed, but a model for the rates is often more convenient and natural, e.g., for simulation. We examine and provide insight on the relationship between these two types of modeling. In particular, we give explicit formulas for the relationship between the correlation between rates and that between counts in two given periods, and for the variance and dispersion index in a given period. These formulas imply that for a given correlation between the rates, the correlation between the counts is much smaller in low traffic than in high traffic.

Smart meter data for a single building have many uses, such as forecasting and assessing overall building performance. However, when data are available from multiple buildings, there are additional applications that are rarely explored. For instance, we can explore how different building characteristics influence energy demand. If each building is treated as a random effect and building characteristics are handled as fixed effects, a mixed-effects model can be used to estimate how characteristics affect energy usage. In this paper, we demonstrate that producing 1-day-ahead demand predictions for 123 commercial office buildings using mixed models can improve forecasting accuracy. We experiment with random intercept, random intercept and slope and non-linear mixed models. The predictive performance of the mixed-effects models are tested against naive, linear and non-linear benchmark models fitted to each building separately. This research justifies using mixed models to improve forecasting accuracy and to quantify changes in energy consumption under different building configuration scenarios.

One common way this occurs is when servers are hierarchical in their skills or in the level of service they can provide. Much of the literature studying such systems relies on an understanding of the relative costs and benefits associated with serving different customer types by the different levels of service. In this work, we focus on estimating these costs and benefits in a complex healthcare setting where the major differentiation among server types is the intensity of service provided. Step-down units (SDUs) were initially introduced in hospitals to provide an intermediate level of care for semicritically ill patients who are not sick enough to require intensive care but not stable enough to be treated in the general medical/surgical ward. One complicating factor is that the needs of customers is sometimes uncertain—specifically, it is difficult to know a priori which level of care a particular patient needs. Using data from 10 hospitals from a single hospital network, we take a data-driven approach to classify patients based on severity and empirically estimate the clinical and operational outcomes associated with routing these patients to the SDU. Our findings suggest that an SDU may be a cost-effective way to treat patients when used for patients who are post-ICU (intensive care unit). However, the impact of SDU care is more nuanced for patients admitted from the emergency department and may result in increased mortality risk and hospital length of stay for patients who should be treated in the ICU. Our results imply that more study is needed when using SDU care this way. This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.

In practice, different areas often operate with fixed nurse staffing levels. When there are substantial imbalances in congestion among different areas, it could be beneficial to deviate from the original assignment and reassign nurses. However, reassignments typically are only feasible at the beginning of 8–12-h shifts, providing partial flexibility in adjusting staffing levels. In this work, we propose a stochastic queueing network model of patient flow in the ED and study an associated fluid control problem to guide the reassignment decision for two types of nursing staff. We propose a heuristic solution approach and investigate its performance both analytically and using simulation. Analytical results and simulation experiments suggest a significant reduction of waiting times in parameter regimes relevant to the ED setting. We further implement the staffing approach at a large ED. This pilot study highlights several challenges of implementing operational interventions in the ED, including the difficulty of establishing a clean statistical environment in such setting. Despite these challenges, we find that guiding reassignment decisions using our approach is associated with significant improvements to patient flow including a reduction in average total ED length-of-stay of 1.7 h.

In this article, we study the dynamic assignment of servers to different areas of a service system at the beginning of discrete time intervals, namely, shifts. The ability to reassign servers at discrete intervals, rather than continuously, introduces a partial flexibility that provides an opportunity for reducing the expected waiting time of customers. The problem is primarily motivated by an application to nurse staffing in emergency departments (EDs), where nurses can work in different areas of the ED, but their assignment can only be changed at the beginning of their shifts (typically 8–12 hours). To investigate the reassignment decision and its potential benefits, we consider a multiclass queueing system, where customers of each class differ in terms of their average service requirements and the holding cost incurred as they wait in the queues. We study a discrete-time fluid control problem to minimize transient holding costs over a finite horizon and show that an appropriate “translation” of the solution to the fluid control problem is asymptotically optimal for the original stochastic system. Through analysis of the fluid control problem we further obtain insights on the structure of “good” policies in the presence of the shift constraint. Leveraging these insights, we develop heuristic policies and use simulation to demonstrate their effectiveness in systems with dynamics often observed in EDs. We find that, in a parameter regime relevant to our motivating application, the partial flexibility introduced by reassigning servers at the beginning of shifts can substantially reduce the expected cost of the system—by 10%–50% in some parameter regimes—compared with the status quo, dedicated staffing.

Therefore, service providers strive for volume flexibility to cope with this challenge. In manufacturing context, a shift of excess demand to an external partner is already common practice while service providers reacted reluctantly to this possibilities in fear of high integration costs. The uprising of new technologies such as Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) lowered these cost and allowed the separation of up to now entangled software functionalities into services and the use of standardized interfaces. Nevertheless, investment decisions related to SOA oftentimes lack a well-founded valuation of the respective benefits. Therefore, we present an analytical model based on the Real Options Approach (ROA) that determines the business valu of flexibility resulting from an IS-based integration of an external service vendor. Thereby we consider the trade-off between the investments into the technical requirements (e.g. SOA) that are necessary to gain volume flexibility on the one hand and the negative effects of unsatisfied customers on the customer equity on the other hand. We also provide first insights into the applicability of the model via a demonstration example.

Our goal is to study the impact of such dependence on key performance measures, such as expected waiting times and average queue length, as well as on optimal capacity decisions. Since the dependence structure renders exact analysis intractable, we employ a stationary fluid approximation that is based on the entire joint distribution of the service and patience times. Our results show that even moderate dependence has significant impacts on system performance, so considering the patience and service times to be independent when they are in fact dependent is futile. We further demonstrate that Pearson’s correlation coefficient, which is commonly used to measure and rank dependence, is an insufficient statistic, and that the entire joint distribution is required for comparative statics. Thus, we propose a novel framework, incorporating the fluid model with bivariate dependence orders and copulas, to study the impacts of the aforementioned dependence. We then demonstrate how that framework can be applied to facilitate revenue optimization when staffing and abandonment costs are incurred. Finally, the effectiveness of the fluid-based approximations and optimal-staffing prescriptions is demonstrated via simulations.

Traditional service level calculation methods are based on the queue theory, which has very strict restrictions and is not suitable for real scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, a data-driven method to solve the service level prediction problem is proposed to be used. To this end, the relationship between service level and other factors, such as number of calls, number of agents, time, is explored. Then some features are extracted based on empirical analyses and propose to use decision tree based ensemble methods, like random forest and GBDT, to model the relationship between service level and input features. Finally, extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other baselines significantly. Especially compared with the traditional queue theory methods, our method improves the performance by 6% and 9% in terms of MAE and MAPE.

However, traditional mathematical service level prediction models have strict restrictions and suffer from accuracy degradation in complex real scenarios. In this paper, we propose to use a Siamese neural network to solve the service level prediction problem. This task is challenging due to two reasons: insufficient information and prior knowledge constraint. To tackle these issues, we develop a method entitled SiaSL based on the Siamese neural network. Our model consists of three key modules: 1) a time embedding module to embed the time period into low-dimensional vectors to model the time-independent characteristics of the service level, 2) a feature extractor to extract deep feature from raw scheduling information, 3) an output module to predict the final service level. Besides, to make SiaSL learn the prior knowledge, we propose a data augmentation method and an iterative training mechanism. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. On the premise of satisfying prior knowledge, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this problem.

Even the number of VIPs is few, once operators miss or late to response calls from a VIP, the possibility of losing the revenues is potentially huge. Therefore, if a company needs to satisfy VIP's needs, the manager must provide two different services of call center. Because employee salary forms the most parts of costs, hiring many operators is not a good idea. Partial operators must be reserved to answer VIP's calls. Because operators serve not only VIPs but also regular customers, how many operators can be reserved efficiently is important to discuss. To answer aforementioned questions, the opportunity costs must be considered to find the feasible reservation. In this study, the costs have be derived from the proposed queueing model to find the optimal operators' reservations

The problem is addressed by formulating a succession of stochastic optimization problems solved at the time of resource allocation. Solutions of these problems are derived by applying duality theory.

Although offshoring and outsourcing have been studied from a transactional perspective, the moral issues embedded within these decisions can profoundly affect how the organization is perceived by outside stakeholders. First, we contend that investors use different moral paradigms compared with consumer stakeholders, as a result the stakeholder role an individual occupies significantly influences their ethical evaluation of offshoring and outsourcing decisions. Next, we examine whether embedded issues of product quality and information security increase the moral intensity of offshoring and outsourcing decisions, thereby negatively influencing ethical evaluations. Using vignettes, we find that respon- dents viewed either offshoring or outsourcing less favorably than relocation. Surprisingly, respondents viewed offshoring with data security risks more negatively than offshore outsourcing with quality risks, suggesting that the issue of information security has a greater moral intensity than the issue of product or service quality for both consumer and investor stakeholders. Thus, we show that that embedded issues play a significant role in stakeholders’ ethical judgments of business decisions, such as offshoring and outsourcing.

Based on an examination of 70 SLAs from practice, we conclude that in terms of evaluating fill rate, these SLAs vary in at least three key dimensions: (i) Supplier performance can be evaluated for each demand request or over some longer horizon, (ii) the acceptable fill rate can be 100% or something less than 100%, and (iii) the non-compliance charge can be a flat fee, a per-unit-short fee, or both. For a supplier operating a periodic-review inventory system and serving multiple retailers, each with an SLA, we investigate the impact of inventory allocation rules on SLA compliance and expected non-compliance costs across the three dimensions of review horizon, fill rate target and non-compliance cost structure. We derive several analytic results when retailers are symmetric. For the single-period setting and a fill rate target of 100%, we characterize the optimal allocation rule and rank other rules common in practice and the literature. We also characterize the optimal rule for the single-period setting when the fill rate target is less than 100% and the SLA specifies a flat-fee non-compliance charge. In the multiple-period case, we characterize the optimal rule when the fill rate target is 100%. When the fill rate target is less than 100% and the performance review horizon is more than one period, we develop a simple heuristic that outperforms common allocation rules.

In this model, there are two types of customers and three groups of servers who have different skills. We obtained the state-transition rates by using results from an M/M/c/c loss queuing system. We then established equations for the steady-state probabilities of the system. Following that, we obtained the computational formula for the service level and established the staffing calculation model for the optimal number of agents in each group. Subsequently, we adopted the implicit enumeration method to find the solution, and through the numerical examples, we investigated the effects of model’s parameters on the results.

In this study, we examine a service system with two consecutive steps that have shared resources. The service process consists of a base service (first step in the process) followed by a second step that adds additional value. We first look at a social surplus maximizing service provider (SP) who decides the optimal service capacity and re-optimizes in response to changes in the speed of service of the first step due to local innovations. Our main objective is to explore using simple and stylized models, the effect on the service system of local innovations in step 1 that decrease this step's service times. We find that the effect of such innovations can sometimes lead to the worsening of certain critical service quality measures when SPs are monopolists. Next, using a model of competition, we find that this effect continues to hold in settings where SPs compete for arrivals. Our results have interesting consequences for many service systems and may help explain some of the unintended effects of service innovations reported in the literature.

Customers procure the service based on the expected value to be delivered, prices charged, and the timeliness of service. We investigate the performance of the optimal pricing scheme as well as two commonly used pricing schemes (fixed fee and time-based pricing) for such services on important dimensions such as revenue, demand served, and utilization. We propose a novel model that captures the above features and wherein both service rate and demand are endogenous and functions of the pricing scheme. In particular, service time is an outcome of the pricing scheme adopted and the heterogeneous valuations of customers, unlike in the queueing-based pricing literature. We find that the service system may benefit from a greater variance in consumer valuations, and the performance of pricing schemes is impacted by the shape of the distribution of customers' valuation of service time and the responsiveness desired by customers. Both the fixed fee and time-based schemes do well relative to the optimal pricing scheme in terms of revenue in many plausible scenarios, but there are substantial differences between the pricing schemes in some important operational metrics. For instance, the fixed fee scheme serves more customers and has higher utilization than the time-based scheme. We also explore variants of the fixed and time-based schemes that have better revenue performance and show that the two-part tariff which is a combination of fixed and time-based pricing can do as well as the optimal scheme in terms of revenue.

The system, SPRINT, which is based on state-of-the-art demand forecasting, implements a novel two-phase optimization procedure based on adaptive staffing. The processes developed proved to be superior to other state-of-the-art approaches. After using the system for two years, Hera has considerably improved its planning and management processes, achieved a significant level-of-service improvement of its desk customer services, and substantially increased staff productivity.

Cross-trained workers can be switched between the two rooms depending on demand but are more expensive than specialized ones. Assuming stochastic customer arrival and service times, we seek a smallest-cost combination of cross-trained and specialized workers, together with a policy for switching the cross-trained workers between the rooms, which satisfies constraints on the expected customer waiting time and expected number of workers in the back room. A constraint programming approach using logic-based Benders' decomposition is presented. Experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of this approach across a wide variety of problem parameters. This paper provides one of the first links between queueing optimization problems and constraint programming.

One of the most important aspects considered by call center managers is the optimization of its operators, which implies covering the highly variable demand and finding an efficient way to assign people to certain shifts in order to achieve a desirable service level and abandonment rate. Another challenge is determining which system setup is appropriate for the specific call center. Should we have a single-skill call center or multi-skill call center? If we do have the latter, how many multi-skill agents should we have on staff? In this case study, we generate and analyze discrete-event systems simulation-optimization models to test the behavior of a real-world call center under the actual configuration and under different levels of cross-training. The model results help call center managers by: 1) determining the optimal number of operators needed for different staff configurations in order to achieve the targets for service level and abandonment, 2) providing information about the trade-off between the key measurements in the call center, and 3) providing useful information about the number of operators needed and used for each hour of operation to estimate the number of four-hour shifts required to achieve the performance targets. Our experimental findings from this case study suggest that a bi-skill call center is economically better in the long-run compared to a full-skill or single-skill call center. This case study augments the call center body of knowledge by providing additional managerial insights for the operations management community.

Since labor consumes over 50% of the total monies invested in EDs and other healthcare systems, any downsizing, streamlining and reorganization plan needs to first address staffing issues such as determining the correct size of the workforce and its work shift scheduling. In this context, it is very important to remember that downsizing certainly does not mean a general cut-across-the-board. This study shows that a selective downsizing process in which each resource is treated separately (increasing the work capacity of some resources is also possible), based on its unique contribution to the overall ED operational performance, can approximately maintain current ED operational measures in terms patient length of stay (LOS) despite an overall reduction in staff hours. A linear optimization model (S-model) and a heuristic iterative simulation based algorithm (SWSSA) are used in this study for scheduling the resources’ work shifts, one resource at a time. The algorithm was tested using data that was gathered from five general hospital EDs. By leveling the workload of the different resources in the ED, SWSSA was able to achieve LOS values within −19 to 4% of the original values despite a reduction of 8–17.5% in physicians’ work hours and a reduction of 13–47% in the nurses’ work hours.

The current study concentrates on developing efficient work shift schedules that make the best use of current resource capacity with the objectives of reducing patient waiting time and leveling resource utilization as much as possible. The study introduces two iterative heuristic algorithms, which combine simulation and optimization models for scheduling the work shifts of the ED resources: physicians, nurses and technicians. The algorithms are distinctive because they account for patients being treated by multiple care providers, possibly over the course of several hours, often with interspersed waiting. In such instances, patient arrival time is not a good indicator of when the various care providers are needed. The algorithms were tested using a detailed simulation based on data from five general hospital EDs. A patient's Length of Stay (LOS) is measured as the time a patient spends in the ED until being admitted to the hospital or discharged. The first algorithm achieved an average reduction of between 20 and 45% in the total patient waiting time, which led to a reduction of between 7 and 17% in the combined average patient LOS. By allowing a restructure of the ED resource capacities, the second algorithm achieved an average reduction of between 20 and 64% in the total patient waiting time, leading to an 11 to 29% reduction in the combined average patient LOS.

We take an economic and operational (patient flow) perspective to analyze the effectiveness of this policy in encouraging hospitals to reduce readmissions. We develop a game-theoretic model that captures the competition among hospitals inherent in HRRP’s benchmarking mechanism. We show that this competition can be counterproductive: it increases the number of nonincentivized hospitals, which prefer paying penalties over reducing readmissions in any equilibrium. We calibrate our model with a data set of more than 3,000 hospitals in the United States and show that under the current policy, and for a large set of parameters, 4%–13% of the hospitals remain nonincentivized to reduce readmissions. We also validate our model against the actual performance of hospitals in the three years since the introduction of the policy. We draw several policy recommendations to improve this policy’s outcome. For example, localizing the benchmarking process—comparing hospitals against similar peers—improves the performance of the policy.

Each job has a random lifetime during which it is available for nonpreemptive service. Should a job's lifetime expire before its service begins then it is lost from the system unserved. The goal is to schedule the jobs for service to maximize the expected number served to completion. Two heuristics have been proposed in the literature. One (labeled πS) operates a static priority among the job classes and works well in a “no premature job loss” limit, whereas the second (πM) is a myopic heuristic which works well when lifetimes are short. Both can exhibit poor performance for problems at some distance from the regimes for which they were designed. We develop a robustly good heuristic by an approximative approach to the application of a policy improvement step to the asymptotically optimal heuristic πS, in which we use a fluid model to obtain an approximation for the value function of πS. The performance of the proposed heuristic is investigated in an extensive numerical study. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics 2010

However, real-life service systems are staffed by people, and people may change their service speed in response to incentives. The delicacy is that the resulting service speed is jointly affected by staffing, routing, and payment decisions. Our objective in this paper is to find a joint staffing, routing, and payment policy that induces optimal service-system performance. We do this under the assumption that there is a trade-off between service speed and quality and that employees are paid based on both. The employees selfishly choose their own service speed to maximize their own expected utility (which depends on the staffing through their busy time). The endogenous service-rate assumption leads to a centralized control problem in which the system manager jointly optimizes over the staffing, routing, and service rate. By solving the centralized control problem under fluid scaling, we find four different economically optimal operating regimes: critically loaded, efficiency driven, quality driven, and intentional idling (in which there is simultaneous customer abandonment and server idling). Then we show that a simple piece-rate payment scheme can be used to solve the associated decentralized control problem under fluid scaling.

In this chapter, I briefly discuss and summarize the historical inventory management successes achieved collectively by academics and practitioners. This historical success has largely come from reductions in upstream inventories held by manufacturers. I conjecture that future improvements must largely come from downstream inventories, and I discuss three areas of challenge and opportunity: (1) Rapidly changing product and delivery variety offered to the customer, (2) information sharing between channel partners, and (3) aligning incentives between channel partners.

Key findings that underpin the approximation are that time lags between peaks in arrival rates and congestion levels can be ignored, queue behaviour is insensitive to distribution of service time beyond its mean, and distribution of number in the system is near Normal. This model is then used to derive valuable management implications for service-orientated systems where delays are frequent and abandonments are an important feature. Key insights are that such systems can often adopt very ‘sub-optimal’ behaviour, and that customer impatience can be very beneficial where management wishes to improve system performance. ‘Optimal’ performance is defined, and practical measures for queue managers to move system performance towards ‘optimality’ are identified.

Services typically have variability in both the pattern of customer arrivals and service times, which make capacity planning challenging. Workers also have discretion over the workflow, and therefore each worker can affect the workload passed to other parts of the system. When a service process is outsourced, this discretion may be in the hands of a vendor who then makes choices that influence the customer experience. A firm must decide upon the design of the process, which parts of the process to outsource, and how to contract with the vendor to overcome issues related to information asymmetry. This paper addresses these questions within the context of a two-level service process where the first level serves as a gatekeeper for experts in the second level. We integrate the results from several papers in the literature to give a comprehensive perspective on how to approach service outsourcing.

Standard economic and learning models predict that focal firms should outsource either all or none of a particular activity unless extra resources are required during cyclical demand peaks or access is needed to some tightly appropriable intellectual property. However, recent evidence shows that, even when these exceptions do not apply, many firms pursue a partial outsourcing strategy. We develop a dynamic optimization model to provide a rational explanation for this observation. In our model, learning from prior projects occurs at both the subsystem level and the overall systems level (e.g., systems integration and architecture). Learning at the two levels interacts such that integration capabilities can dynamically build and decay. The model generates conditions where partial outsourcing is rational and dominates the extreme conditions of complete insourcing or complete outsourcing. Our model also specifies the conditions for regime change between insourcing and outsourcing and cycling between insourcing and outsourcing, and overshooting or undershooting the long-run outsourcing target. Furthermore, we show that these results are highly path-dependent under short horizons. The model also provides explanation for interesting questions such as why the rate of outsourcing might be U-shaped in the rate of technological change and why startups so often insource in contrast to more established counterparts in similar industries.

We report numerical results to show effectiveness of our new reformulations and approaches by finding global solutions of small-medium sized problems. The combination of model reformulation and a separation algorithm is particularly noteworthy in terms of computational speed.

The method uses the linear mixed model that makes it possible to model both between-subject and within-subject variation in energy expenditure. More precisely, a random-intercepts model is used. The variance and mean of the acceleration signals at 15-second intervals as well as subject demographics (height, weight, body mass index, age and VO2max) are used. Energy expenditure is modelled in four different activities: walking, running, Nordic walking and bicycling. This study introduces an effective backward model selection procedure for selecting the fixed-effect variables in the model. The procedure uses leave-one-out cross-validation to be able to effectively exploit the available data set and to ensure the robustness of the model. Estimation accuracy in test sets is used as a criterion of model performance. The model selection procedure proposed notably improves estimation accuracy. In walking, running, Nordic walking and bicycling, average estimation errors of 3.9, 3.6, 1.9 and13.5 percent are reached. The respective Pearson correlations for these activities are 0.91, 0.98, 0.97, and 0.81. These results are also compared to the performance of the general linear model. It is discovered that the linear mixed model outperforms the model that does not take the individual levels of energy expenditure of the subjects into account.

The requester is the primary caregiver responsible for managing the health of a population of patients. When a patient requires advanced care outside of the requester’s expertise, the requester refers the patient to a provider and pays for the referral services. Treatment may succeed or fail, and in the case of failure, the requester incurs further follow-up costs. The requester may exert preventive effort to reduce the volume of referrals. The provider may exert nonreimbursable effort to reduce the chance of treatment failure. We analyze payment contracts between the two firms. We find that fee-for-service (FFS) induces neither system nor social optimum effort outcomes. However, a penalty contract can generally coordinate the effort decisions with either the system optimum or the social optimum. Furthermore, we find that patients may benefit from having a coordinating contract replace FFS. However, the types of procedures that make a coordinating contract most advantageous for the requester and provider are not necessarily the same as those that make the patients better off than under FFS. Yet, in most cases, the coordinating contract improves social welfare, as compared to FFS, and brings it close to the social optimum. Hence, the requester–provider coordinating contract can be considered as an improvement over FFS for the entire system. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.3000.

Our main aim is to dynamically assign requests to agents considering the priority and complexity levels of requests. We model this system as a Markov chain that is infinite in multiple dimensions and thus is not amenable to exact analysis. We therefore apply approximation and bounding techniques to develop a tractable, novel algorithm using the Matrix Analytic Method. Our algorithm closely approximates the operations of the real-world service system under a simple but effective threshold-based request-assignment policy. Extensive computational results demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm to minimize costs given an existing staffing configuration, as well as in helping to make long-term staffing decisions. In addition, our algorithm also has at least two orders of magnitude shorter computation times than each replication of simulation. Hence, it is both fast and accurate.

In this work, various tactical and operational issues concerning real-time fleet management are studied. First, we introduce the Dynamic and Stochastic Traveling Salesman Problem and propose an optimal policy through a Markov Decision Process as well as develop lower and upper bounds on the optimal policy cost. Then, we present several strategies for implementing a priori routes, and we identify situations in which the use of more involved a priori strategies can give some benefit. Next, we consider the Dynamic and Stochastic Vehicle Dispatching Problem with Pickups and Deliveries, for which we develop anticipatory algorithms that evaluate alternative solutions through a short-term demand sampling and a fully sequential procedure for indifference zone selection. Finally, we propose Approximated Neighborhood Evaluation procedures for the same-day Courier Shift Scheduling Problem, a tactical problem which amounts to minimizing the staffing cost subject to probabilistic service level requirements.

By carefully examining the significant effect of personnel scheduling on the production of goods and services, achieving a fair distribution of work among the employees paves the way for higher motivation and performance of the employees, particularly, in production and service industries. In this paper, a systematic literature review (SLR) approach is used to demonstrate the necessity of scheduling studies in order to overcome the deficiencies in auxiliary activity groups. It sheds light on a new and very important areas such as examining the model structures of sector differences, and guiding researchers. New trends and approaches are presented for the personnel scheduling problems. Different classification perspectives are displayed.

We start by highlighting a number of specific operational features that differentiate financial services from other service industries, and discuss how these features affect the modeling of financial services. We then consider in more detail the various different research areas in financial services, namely systems design, performance analysis and productivity, forecasting, inventory and cash management, waiting line analysis for capacity planning, personnel scheduling, operational risk management, and pricing and revenue management. In the last section, we describe the most promising research directions for the near future.

We present a mathematical model which minimizes the transportation costs while satisfying service level and personnel constraints. We test our model with data from call centers.
Emre Nadar,  Mustafa Akan,  Alan Scheller-Wolf;2015;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12498;Experimental Results Indicating Lattice-Dependent Policies May Be Optimal for General Assemble-To-Order Systems;Production and Operations Management;https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12498;20;wiley;bhandari_et_al_2008;True;1059-1478;A;Abstract We consider an assemble-to-order (ATO) system with multiple products, multiple components which may be demanded in different quantities by different products, possible batch ordering of components, random lead times, and lost sales. We model the system as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process under the average cost criterion. A control policy specifies when a batch of components should be produced, and whether an arriving demand for each product should be satisfied. Previous work has shown that a lattice-dependent base-stock and lattice-dependent rationing (LBLR) policy is an optimal stationary policy for a special case of the ATO model presented here (the generalized M-system). In this study, we conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the use of an LBLR policy for our general ATO model as a heuristic, comparing it to two other heuristics from the literature: a state-dependent base-stock and state-dependent rationing (SBSR) policy, and a fixed base-stock and fixed rationing (FBFR) policy. Remarkably, LBLR yields the globally optimal cost in each of more than 22,500 instances of the general problem, outperforming SBSR and FBFR with respect to both objective value (by up to 2.6% and 4.8%, respectively) and computation time (by up to three orders and one order of magnitude, respectively) in 350 of these instances (those on which we compare the heuristics). LBLR and SBSR perform significantly better than FBFR when replenishment batch sizes imperfectly match the component requirements of the most valuable or most highly demanded product. In addition, LBLR substantially outperforms SBSR if it is crucial to hold a significant amount of inventory that must be rationed.

Simplified models that provide tractable formulas are unrealistic in general. In this paper we explore an intermediate solution, based on an approximate continuous-time Markov chain model of the call center. This model is more accurate than the commonly used approximations, and yet can be simulated faster than a more realistic simulation (based on non-exponential distributions and additional details). To speed up the simulation, we uniformize the Markov chain and simulate only its discrete-time version. We show how performance measures such as the fraction of calls of each type answered within a given waiting time limit can be recovered from this simulation, how to synchronize common random numbers in this setting, and how to use this in the first phase of an optimization algorithm based on the cutting plane method. We also discuss various implementation issues and provide empirical results.

Based on Gartner selection criteria, we explore the attractiveness of Suriname for providing call center services. Two case studies, including six interviews, are conducted as the method for exploring this question. The interviewees indicated that language capabilities, low cost, and the availably of qualified resources have been the main drivers for sourcing call center services out of Suriname. The anticipated decrease in connectivity cost will also increase Suriname’s attractiveness in providing call center services. Additionally, we identify improvement areas, such as increasing the onshore/offshore ratio and English-language call center services. A major limitation of this research is that the interviews are limited to representatives employed by call centers in Suriname, which adds significant bias to the study.

Dynamic Order Allocation in a Hybrid Workforce;Management Science;https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4177;10;pubsonline;bhandari_et_al_2008;True;0025-1909;A+;Abstract Modern digital technology has enabled the emergence of the hybrid workforce in service organizations, where a firm uses on-demand freelancers to augment its traditional labor supply of employees. Freelancers are typically supplied by an electronic platform. How should demand be allocated between employees and freelancers? Under what conditions is the system (comprising the firm and its platform) sustainable in the long run? We investigate these questions in the context of last-mile delivery. We develop a discrete-time, stochastic dynamic program that captures the system’s profit from serving demand and the platform’s growth dynamics. The dynamic model incorporates a service constraint for the platform and a simple version of a stochastic network effect. We find that the answers to our research questions critically depend on two key parameters: the mean and variance of the cross-network effect. We conduct a numerical study with data from a last-mile delivery firm in Vietnam to illustrate our findings. This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.

In hospital settings, both medical staff and patients are required to wear PPE. As these facilities resume regular operations, staff will be required to wear PPE at all times while additional PPE will be mandated during medical procedures. This will put increased pressure on hospitals which have had problems predicting PPE usage and sourcing its supply. To meet this challenge, we propose an approach to predict demand for PPE. Specifically, we model the admission of patients to a medical department using multiple independent M_{t}/G/\infty queues. Each queue represents a class of patients with similar treatment plans and hospital length-of-stay. By estimating the total workload of each class, we derive closed-form estimates for the expected amount of PPE required over a specified time horizon using current PPE guidelines. We apply our approach to a data set of 22,039 patients admitted to the general internal medicine department at St. Michael’s hospital in Toronto, Canada from April 2010 to November 2019. We find that gloves and surgical masks represent approximately 90% of predicted PPE usage. We also find that while demand for gloves is driven entirely by patient-practitioner interactions, 86% of the predicted demand for surgical masks can be attributed to the requirement that medical practitioners will need to wear them when not interacting with patients.

We model the problem as a multi-class queueing network with new and returning customers, time-dependent arrivals, and abandonment. We derive its fluid approximation, a system of ordinary linear differential equations with continuous, piecewise smooth, right-hand sides. Based on the fluid model, we propose a novel approach to determine optimal stationary staffing levels for new and returning customer queues in anticipation of future time-varying dynamics. Using system accessibility as a proxy for service quality and staffing levels as a proxy for investment, we demonstrate how to apply our approach to two families of time-varying arrival functions motivated by real-world applications: an advertising campaign and a clinical setting. In a numerical study, we demonstrate that our approach creates staffing policies that maximize throughput while balancing acquisition and retention efforts more effectively (i.e., equitable abandonment from each customer class) than commonly used near-stationary methods such as variants of square-root staffing policies. Our model confirms that acquisition and retention efforts are intimately linked, this has been found in empirical studies but not captured in the operations literature. We suggest that in time-varying environments, focusing on either alone is not sufficient to maintain high levels of throughput and service quality.

A convenient paradigm to solve such problems takes a deterministic recursion, e.g., Newton-type or trust-region, and replaces function values and derivatives appearing in the recursion with their sampled counterparts. While such a paradigm is convenient, there is as yet no clear guidance on how much simulation effort should be expended as the resulting recursion evolves through the search space. In this paper, we take the first steps towards answering this question. We propose using a fully sequential Monte Carlo sampling method to adaptively decide how much to sample at each point visited by the stochastic recursion. The termination criterion for such sampling is based on a certain relative width confidence interval constructed to ensure that the resulting iterates are consistent, and efficient in a rigorous (Monte Carlo canonical) sense. The methods presented here are adaptive in the sense that they “learn” to sample according to the algorithm trajectory. In this sense, our methods should be seen as refining recent methods in a similar context that use a predetermined sequence of sample sizes.

We use a standard approach for predicting the load in the next 10 min, while, for a forecast horizon of one day, we represent the data with a high-dimensional multi-variate TS, where the number of variables is equivalent to the quantity of measurements registered in a day. Through the orthogonal transformation returned by PCA decomposition, we reduce the dimensionality of the TS to a lower number k of distinct variables, this allows us to cast the original prediction problem in k different one-step ahead predictions. The overall forecast can be effectively managed by k distinct prediction models, whose outputs are combined together to obtain the final result. We employ a genetic algorithm for tuning the parameters of the ESN and compare its prediction accuracy with a standard autoregressive integrated moving average model.

We provide fluid and diffusion approximations of the number of users within the membership who are requesting service. The approximations are obtained via many-server limit theorems, where the limiting regime assumptions of each theorem correspond to a particular staffing strategy a manager might employ. Accordingly, we propose staffing rules designed to meet a certain desired performance criterion. In particular, when the objective is to minimize the staffing size subject to a constraint on the probability of delay for a service-requesting customer, we suggest staffing rules inspired by the so-called quality- and efficiency-driven (QED), or Halfin-Whitt, limiting regime. Numerical evaluations of our proposed QED scheme indicate that, although justified for large systems, the staffing rule performs well for memberships of all sizes.

Erlang-R accommodates customers who return to service several times during their sojourn within the system, and its modeling power is most pronounced in time-varying environments. Indeed, it was motivated by healthcare systems, in which offered-loads vary over time and patients often go through a repetitive service process. Erlang-R helps answer questions such as how many servers (physicians/nurses) are required to achieve predetermined service levels. Formally, it is merely a two-station open queueing network, which, in a steady state, evolves like an Erlang-C (M/M/s) model. In time-varying environments, on the other hand, the situation differs: here one must account for the reentrant nature of service to avoid excessive staffing costs or undesirable service levels. We validate Erlang-R against an emergency ward (EW) operating under normal conditions as well as during a mass casualty event (MCE). In both scenarios, we apply time-varying fluid and diffusion approximations: the EW is critically loaded and the MCE is overloaded. In particular, for the EW we propose a time-varying square-root staffing policy, based on the modified offered-load, which is proved to perform well over small-to-large systems.

We show that such a policy has the potential of both improving service performance and server utilization, by balancing the load between overloaded and underloaded periods. However, our analysis suggests that companies need not offer that service at all times, and that the delay guarantees proposed should be planned according to the anticipated load throughout the day. In order to optimize the operation of such a system, we develop an Iterative Simulation Algorithm to determine what delay guarantees the company should offer in a time-varying environment. Those guarantees depend on service level targets the company wishes to provide and the delay sensitivity of the online vs. off-line customers."

Effective distribution of complex customer workloads among delivery teams served by diverse personnel under strict service agreements is a serious management challenge. Challenges become more pronounced when organizations adopt ad-hoc measures to reduce operational costs and mandate unscientific transformations. This paper simulates different delivery models in face of complex customer workload, stringent service contracts, and evolving skills, with the goal of scientifically deriving design principles of delivery organizations. Results show while Collaborative models are beneficial for highest priority work, Integrated models works best for volume-intensive work, through up-skilling the population with additional skills. In repetitive work environments where expertise can be gained, these training costs are compensated with higher throughput. This return-on-investment is highest when people have at most two skills. Decoupled models work well for simple workloads and relaxed service contracts.

Efficient management of call centers needs accurate modeling of customer waiting behavior, which contains important information about customer patience (how long a customer is willing to wait) and service quality (how long a customer needs to wait to get served). Hazard functions offer dynamic characterization of customer waiting behavior, and provide critical inputs for agent scheduling. Motivated by this application, we develop a two-way functional hazards (tF-Hazards) model to study customer waiting behavior as a function of two timescales, waiting duration and the time of day that a customer calls in. The model stems from a two-way piecewise constant hazard function, and imposes low-rank structure and smoothness on the hazard rates to enhance interpretability. We exploit an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to optimize a penalized likelihood function of the model. We carefully analyze the data from a U.S. Bank call center, and provide informative insights about customer patience and service quality patterns along waiting time and across different times of a day. The findings provide primitive inputs for call center agent staffing and scheduling, as well as for call center practitioners to understand the effect of system protocols on customer waiting behavior.

In the management of call center networks, these partnerships are common and form an integral part of the customer care and marketing strategies in the financial services industry. For a financial services firm, configuring such a call center service network entails determining which partners to select and how to distribute service requests among vendors, while incorporating their capabilities, costs, and revenue-generating abilities. Motivated by a problem facing a Fortune 500 financial services provider, we develop and apply a novel mixed integer programming model for the service network configuration problem. Our tactical decision support model effectively accounts for the firm's costs by capturing the impact of service requirements on vendor staffing levels and seat requirements, and permits imposing call routing preferences and auxiliary service costs. We implemented the model and applied it to data from an industry partner. Results suggest that our approach can generate considerable cost savings and substantial additional revenues, while ensuring high service quality. Results based on test instances demonstrate similar savings and outperform two rule-based methods for vendor assignment.

The model allocates the budget dynamically to three types of nursing care capacities: 1) permanent nurses, 2) temporary nurses, and 3) overtime. The quarterly tactical decisions are the aggregate weekly shift pattern of permanent nurses and the policy for hiring temporary nurses and using overtime. The decisions are optimized with respect to nursing care shortage and a soft-constraint on the annual budget. For the aggregate weekly shift pattern, permanent nurses require a notification lead-time of one quarter to prepare the personal rosters. Our model offers a solution to the nursing service budgeting problem that extends the existing literature by using a Markovian demand model, resolving the anticipation of the operational decisions, and applying general budget as well as shortage penalty functions.

The accuracy of such forecasts is critical for the smooth functioning of security checkpoints where unexpected surges in passenger volumes are handled proactively. In this article, we present a forecasting model that combines flight schedules and other business fundamentals with historically observed throughput patterns to predict passenger volumes in a multi-terminal multi-security screening checkpoint airport. We then present an optimization model and a solution strategy for dynamically selecting a configuration of open screening lanes to minimize passenger queues and wait times that at the same time determine workforce allocations. We present a real-world case study in a US airport to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed models.

We focus on streamlining service levels i.e., finding right resolution level for each ticket, to reduce time, efforts and cost for ticket handling, without affecting workloads and user satisfaction. We formalize this problem and present two statistics-based search algorithms for identifying problems suitable for left-shift (from expensive, expertise intensive L2 level to cheaper, simpler L1 level) and right-shift (from L1 to L2). The approach is domain-driven: it produces directly usable and often novel results, without any trial-and error experimentation, along with detailed justifications and predicted impacts. This helps in acceptance among end-users and more active use of the results. We discuss one real-life case-study of results produced by the algorithms.

Their efficiency is especially significant since long queuing times can reduce customer satisfaction. Assembling the call centre work schedule is a complex task that needs to take various and often mutually conflicting goals into account. In this paper, we present a workforce scheduling system suited for small to medium call centres and adjusted to the needs of two real–world client institutions. The scheduling problem is to minimise the difference between allocated and forecasted number of staff members while also caring for numerous legal and organisational constraints as well as staff preferences. A flexible constraint handling framework is devised to enable rapid prototyping methodology used during the development. Based on it, two metaheuristics are devised for schedule construction: GRASP and iterated local search. Performance analysis and comparisons for these two methods are provided, on a real–world problem example. The devised system is successfully implemented in a real world setting of call centres at PBZCard, Croatian largest credit card vendor and PBZ (Intesa Sanpaolo), one of the largest Croatian banks.

Especially in stochastic service systems, for example, in call centers, customers may leave the queue if their waiting time exceeds their personal patience. As discussed in the extant literature, it can be useful to use general distributions to model such customer patience. This paper analyzes the time-dependent performance of a multiserver queue with a nonhomogeneous Poisson arrival process with a time-dependent arrival rate, exponentially distributed processing times, and generally distributed time to abandon. Fast and accurate performance approximations are essential for decision support in such queueing systems, but the extant literature lacks appropriate methods for the setting we consider. To approximate time-dependent performance measures for small- and medium-sized systems, we develop a new stationary backlog-carryover (SBC) approach that allows for the analysis of underloaded and overloaded systems. Abandonments are considered in two steps of the algorithm: (i) in the approximation of the utilization as a reduced arrival stream and (ii) in the approximation of waiting-based performance measures with a stationary model for general abandonments. To improve the approximation quality, we discuss an adjustment to the interval lengths. We present a limit result that indicates convergence of the method for stationary parameters. The numerical study compares the approximation quality of different adjustments to the interval length. The new SBC approach is effective for instances with small numbers of time-dependent servers and gamma-distributed abandonment times with different coefficients of variation and for an empirical distribution of the abandonment times from real-world data obtained from a call center. A discrete-event simulation benchmark confirms that the SBC algorithm approximates the performance of the queueing system with abandonments very well for different parameter configurations. Summary of Contribution: The paper presents a fast and accurate numerical method to approximate the performance measures of a time‐dependent queueing system with generally distributed abandonments. The presented stationary backlog carryover approach with abandonment combines algorithmic ideas with stationary queueing models for generally distributed abandonment times. The reliability of the method is analyzed for transient systems and numerically studied with real‐world data.

The trade-off these companies face is lack of control over the service quality, which has affected customer satisfaction in many cases. When a customer's call is routed to a third-party call center rather than handled by the firm itself, the perception of quality loss could be a source of customer dissatisfaction. The problem intensifies when multiple call centers are involved. In our analytical model, the firm uses a contract for the allocation of quantity to motivate the two suppliers to improve their quality. Our results show that such a contract can induce an improvement in service quality in the market. In this way, the outsourcing firm's customers who use the call centers are assured of a higher level of consistent quality even if their calls are routed to one of the third-party call centers. We present analytical results on the optimal policies of both the buyer and the suppliers in a two-supplier market. We also study a more realistic asymmetric information case in which the buyer does not know the value of the suppliers' cost parameter and the buyer has to design a contract under information asymmetry. We also present numerical results. The paper contributes to theory by providing a game-theoretic model for a two-supplier outsourcing case with and without information asymmetry in which a new volume allocation strategy is proposed. The results provide practical guidelines to an outsourcing firm for ways to manipulate market variables to influence the suppliers and obtain higher service quality and profit levels.

Firstly it is demonstrated that the contract of a wholesale price with a lump sum transfer can coordinate the supply chain only when it is enforced under forced compliance. However forced compliance is not a realistic assumption. For coordinating the supply chain, a linear penalty contract is proposed, in which the supplier's penalty is linear with the capacity deficiency. And with the linear penalty contract the supply chain's optimal solution is the unique Nash equilibrium.

Business owners are concerned that the resultant loss of scheduling flexibility could reduce overall operational efficiency. We argue this is not necessarily the case. Academic/practical relevance: Although recent studies suggest that increasing schedule predictability by reducing “just-in-time” scheduling can increase productivity, few have examined the effects of schedule consistency on worker productivity. Our study fills this void by investigating the impact of schedule consistency on cashier productivity in grocery retailing. Methodology: We estimate econometric models using transaction level scanner data including more than 1.2 million shopping baskets processed by 126 cashiers working for a local grocer. Work schedule consistency is operationalized via two metrics: (1) hour-of-the-day consistency measuring whether a cashier is consistently scheduled to work in the same hours of the day, and (2) day-of-the-week consistency measuring whether a cashier is consistently scheduled to work on the same days of the week. Results: We find that, on average, hour-of-the-day consistency and day-of-the-week consistency increase cashier productivity by 0.95% and 1.63%, respectively. These effects are much stronger for inexperienced cashiers (e.g., an average productivity boost of 3.39% and 7.93%, respectively, for the new hires). Managerial implications: Our findings suggest that (a) business owners can increase shift workers’ productivity by providing them with more consistent work schedules, and (b) the productivity of less-experienced shift workers, especially new hires, is more vulnerable to inconsistent work schedules, highlighting the potential for operational efficiency gains from greater schedule consistency, especially for businesses employing a high portion of inexperienced shift workers.

In particular, these inputs may be the customers themselves participating in the service delivery. Although many service firms have explored different ways of involving customers in their production process, there is no clear guideline for the design of such coproductive systems. In this paper, we develop an analytical model of joint production between a service provider and a customer and characterize how a service firm should design its coproductive system. We show that, as a task becomes more standard, it is desirable to decrease the degree of interaction between the provider and the customer by making their efforts more substitutable and to allocate most of the work to whoever is the most efficient. Conversely, as a task becomes less standard, it is optimal to increase interaction by making efforts more complementary and to balance the work allocation. Our analysis gives rise to a service-process framework with three archetypes of coproductive services: collaborative services, service factories, and self-services. We discuss the implications of our results for service process reengineering.

Customer waiting times can be short, with a majority of customers served immediately upon arrival, while server utilizations remain close to 100%. However, we show that this confluence of quality and efficiency is not achieved without risk, because there can be severe congestion if the system does not operate as planned. In particular, we show that the large scale makes the system more vulnerable to service interruptions when (i) most customers remain waiting until they can be served, and (ii) when many servers are unable to function during the interruption, as may occur with a system-wide computer failure. Increasing scale leads to higher server utilizations, which in turn leads to longer recovery times from service interruptions and worse performance during such events. We quantify the impact of service interruptions with increasing scale by introducing and analyzing approximating deterministic fluid models. We also show that these fluid models can be obtained from many-server heavy-traffic limits.

This is done by studying an infinite-server queueing model with time-varying arrival rate, exploiting a recently established heavy-traffic limit, allowing dependence among the service times. This limit shows that the number of customers in the system at any time is approximately Gaussian, where the time-varying mean is unaffected by the dependence, but the time-varying variance is affected by the dependence. As a consequence, required staffing to meet customary quality-of-service targets in a large-scale service system with finitely many servers based on a normal approximation is primarily affected by dependence among the service times through this time-varying variance. This paper develops formulas and algorithms to quantify the impact of the dependence among the service times on that variance. The approximation applies directly to infinite-server models but also indirectly to associated finite-server models, exploiting approximations based on the peakedness (the ratio of the variance to the mean in the infinite-server model). Comparisons with simulations confirm that the approximations can be useful to assess the impact of the dependence.

The service providers employ a large workforce to service many clients, aiming to meet the service-level agreements (SLAs) and deliver a satisfactory client experience. A challenge is that the volumes of service requests change dynamically and the types of such requests are unique to each client. The task of adapting the staffing levels to the workloads in such systems while complying with aggregate SLA constraints is nontrivial. We formulate this problem as a constrained parametrized Markov process with a discrete parameter and propose two multi-timescale smoothed functional (SF)-based stochastic optimization SASOC (staff allocation using stochastic optimization with constraints) algorithms—SASOC-SF-N and SASOC-SF-C—for its solution. Whereas SASOC-SF-N uses a Gaussian-based smoothed functional approach, SASOC-SF-C uses the Cauchy smoothed functional algorithm for primal descent. Further, all SASOC algorithms incorporate a generalized projection operator that extends the system to a continuous setting with suitably defined transition probabilities. We validate these optimization schemes on five real-life service systems and compare their performance with a previous SASOC algorithm and the commercial optimization software OptQuest. Our algorithms are observed to be 25 times faster than OptQuest and have proven convergence guarantees to the optimal staffing levels, whereas OptQuest fails to find feasible solutions in some cases even under a reasonably high threshold on the number of search iterations. From the optimization experiments, we observe that our algorithms find better solutions than OptQuest in many cases, and among our algorithms, SASOC-SF-C performs marginally better than SASOC-SF-N.

We develop methods for interday and dynamic intraday forecasting of incoming call volumes. Our approach is to treat the intraday call volume profiles as a high-dimensional vector time series. We propose first to reduce the dimensionality by singular value decomposition of the matrix of historical intraday profiles and then to apply time series and regression techniques. Our approach takes into account both interday (or day-to-day) dynamics and intraday (or within-day) patterns of call arrivals. Distributional forecasts are also developed. The proposed methods are data driven, appear to be robust against model assumptions in our simulation studies, and are shown to be very competitive in out-of-sample forecast comparisons using two real data sets. Our methods are computationally fast, it is therefore feasible to use them for real-time dynamic forecasting.

Various analysis of real traffic traces have shown that such behaviors in mobile wireless networks vary periodically during the day and night. Other systems also exhibit a similar behavior. A better analysis of the network's performance can be achieved by assuming the traffic behaviors to be non-stationary in such systems. In this paper, a multi-server queueing system is presented where the arrival and service probabilities in each time slot are time-dependent and periodic. The model can be applied for computing the optimal assignment of channels that adheres to certain performance level requirements.

When customers get served, their patience times are right-censored. In addition, the exact event times in call centers are sometimes unobserved and naturally binned into time intervals, due to the design of data collection systems. We develop a TunT (Transform-unTransform) estimator that turns the difficult problem of nonparametric hazard function estimation into a regression problem on binned and right-censored data. Our approach starts with binning event times and transforming event count data with a mean-matching transformation, which enables a simpler characterization of the heteroscedastic variance function. A nonparametric regression technique is then applied to the transformed data. Finally, the estimated regression function is back-transformed to yield an estimator for the original hazard function. The proposed estimation procedure is illustrated using call center data to reveal interesting customer patience behavior, and health insurance plan trial data to compare the effect between treatment and control groups. The numerical study shows that our approach yields more accurate estimates and better staffing decisions than existing methods.

Workforce management of such labor intensive service systems starts with forecasting future arrival demand. We investigate the question of whether and when to jointly forecast future arrivals of the multiple streams. We first develop a general statistical model to simultaneously forecast multi-stream arrival rates. The model takes into account three types of inter-stream dependence. We then show with analytical and simulation studies how the forecasting benefits of the multi-stream forecasting model vary by the type, direction, and strength of inter-stream dependence. In particular, we find that it is beneficial to simultaneously forecast multi-stream arrivals (instead of separately forecasting each stream), when there exists inter-stream lag dependence among daily arrival rates. Empirical studies, using two real call center datasets further demonstrate our findings, and provide operational insights into how one chooses forecasting models for multi-stream arrivals.

We examine how online sellers’ use of live chat influences their online traffic conversion into sales. Like brick-and-mortar stores, a fundamental task for online stores is to convert traffic into purchases, an important problem in retail service operations management. We argue that live chat can increase online sales conversion by performing the functions of informing and persuading. We explore how the two roles of live chat interact with existing information regarding sellers and their products, such as product descriptions, ratings, price, and reviews, as these types of information also influence consumers’ perceived product quality and help mitigate uncertainties in product fit to their needs. We apply a random-coefficient model in a Bayesian hierarchical framework and test the model using a panel dataset from Taobao, the leading C2C platform in China. Our results suggest that live chat has a positive impact on conversion and that the strength of this positive effect depends on seller and product characteristics. The positive effect is stronger when product information on web pages is less comprehensive (where live chat manifests an informative role), and when the perceived value of the product is higher (where live chat manifests a persuasive role) with either a higher product rating or a lower product price. Our results provide relevant and useful implications for online merchants and platform owners.

By forecasting the occurrence of unfortunate events, we can learn from these events and further prevent their occurrence in the future. However, because of the uncertainty of event occurrences, it is hard to guarantee their prediction accuracy. In this paper, a combined model, which consists of two parts, is proposed. The first part is a Poisson neural network model (PNN). It is responsible for basic forecasting, and its initial weights and thresholds are trained by applying a genetic algorithm. The second part consists of multiple linear regression (MLR), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and multivariate gray (GM), which are responsible for estimating residual errors. The basic prediction result adjusted by the residual error is used as the final forecasting result. The proposed model fully takes the advantages of PNN, MLR, ARIMA, and GM, and thus improves forecasting performance. Our method has been applied to the emergency calls of Ningbo, China. The experimental results show that the proposed model has advantages over some existing forecasting models, such as a neural network model, Poisson regression, and stochastic configuration networks in terms of mean absolute percentage error.

We consider a market in which a payer applies a performance-based compensation contract to two competing hospitals. We use G/G/m queuing dynamics to describe the patient care process and include information asymmetry between the payer and the hospitals regarding the hospital operating costs. Our paper is the first to study the performance-based contracting problem in a health care market in the presence of competition on both the quality of and the access to care and the cost information asymmetry between the payer and care providers. We analyze the socially optimal and Nash equilibrium outcomes under bonus compensation where each of the competing hospitals is rewarded based on patient benefits delivered at that hospital. We show that both the stronger competition among hospitals and the introduction of bonus incentives can enhance patient benefits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the presence of information asymmetry between the payer and the hospitals regarding hospitals' operating costs, the social welfare loss generated by the fee-for-service compensation as well as by the optimal bonus contract can be partially mitigated by increasing the degree of competition for patients. Such mitigation effect is amplified when the potential cost differential between the hospitals is sufficiently high and, simultaneously, the correlation between their cost parameters is not too negative.

The goal of our research is to build a unified performance-based contracting (PBC) framework that incorporates patient access-to-care requirements and that explicitly accounts for the complex outpatient care dynamics facilitated by the use of an online appointment scheduling system. We address the optimal contracting problem in a principal–agent framework where a service purchaser (the principal) minimizes her cost of purchasing the services and achieves the performance target (a waiting-time target) while taking into account the response of the provider (the agent) to the contract terms. Given the incentives offered by the contract, the provider maximizes his payoff by allocating his outpatient service capacity among three patient groups: urgent patients, dedicated advance patients, and flexible advance patients. We model the appointment dynamics as that of an M/D/1 queue and analyze several contracting approaches under adverse selection (asymmetric information) and moral hazard (private actions) settings. Our results show that simple and popular schemes used in practice cannot implement the first-best solution and that the linear performance-based contract cannot implement the second-best solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a threshold-penalty PBC approach and show that it coordinates the system for an arbitrary patient mix and that it achieves the second-best performance for the setting where all advance patients are dedicated.

The objective of the system operator (the client) is to minimize the sum of staffing costs, customer waiting costs, and mistreatment costs due to unsuccessful attempts by a gatekeeper to solve the customer's problem. The client may outsource all or part of the process to a vendor, and first-best contracts exist when the client outsources only gatekeepers or experts. When the client outsources the entire system as a two-level process, a client-optimal contract may not exist unless the exogenous system parameters satisfy a particular (and unlikely) coordination condition. In addition, optimal incentive-compatible contracts exist when the vendor's structure choice (one level or two levels) can deviate from the client's preference. Finally, we numerically examine how vendor structure choice and labor cost advantages influence the client's optimal outsourcing option.

Using an emergency department’s (ED) patient-level data from 2007 to 2010, we find that patients’ average wait time and LOS are longer when physicians are assigned patients under a pooled queuing system with a fairness constraint compared to a dedicated queuing system with the same fairness constraint. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find the dedicated queuing system is associated with a 17% decrease in average LOS and a 9% decrease in average wait time relative to the control group—a 39-minute reduction in LOS and a four-minute reduction in wait time for an average patient of medium severity in this ED. Interviews and observations of physicians suggest that the improved performance stems from the physicians’ increased ownership over patients and resources that is afforded by a dedicated queuing system, which enables physicians to more actively manage the flow of patients into and out of ED beds. Our findings suggest that the benefits from improved flow management in a dedicated queuing system can be large enough to overcome the longer wait time predicted to arise from nonpooled queues. We conduct additional analyses to rule out alternate explanations for the reduced average wait time and LOS in the dedicated system, such as stinting and decreased quality of care. Our paper has implications for healthcare organizations and others seeking to reduce patient wait time and LOS without increasing costs.

Despite the existence of detailed protocols and automation, the real behavior is hard to measure and predict. The human factor is a source of uncertainty, and this fact is of special relevance when facing stressful situations. Informal team working culture, time shifts or external stress are main sources of change. In this research we use time series analysis as a statistical proxy to detect this kind of drift in teams that solve network failures if three live services: IPTV, Cloud Infrastructure and IoT. This task known as incident management. This would provide not only a numerical evidence of the uncertainty in troubleshooting of digital services but also an assessment about the economic and operational impact of service releases. Changes in best fitting models may reflect different informal work cultures among the operation teams.

We introduce a formulation of the staffing problem that requires that the QoS constraints are met with high probability with respect to the uncertainty in the demand rate. We contrast this chance-constrained formulation with the average-performance constraints that have been used so far in the literature. We then propose a two-step solution for the staffing problem under chance constraints. In the first step, we introduce a random static planning problem (RSPP) and discuss how it can be solved using two different methods. The RSPP provides us with a first-order (or fluid) approximation for the true optimal staffing levels and a staffing frontier. In the second step, we solve a finite number of staffing problems with known arrival rates—the arrival rates on the optimal staffing frontier. Hence, our formulation and solution approach has the important property that it translates the problem with uncertain demand rates to one with known arrival rates. The output of our procedure is a solution that is feasible with respect to the chance constraint and nearly optimal for large call centers.

This is a system with a single pool of i.i.d. servers that serve one class of impatient i.i.d. customers. Arrivals follow a Poisson process and service times are exponentially distributed as are the customers' patience times. We propose a diffusion approximation that applies simultaneously to all existing many-server heavy-traffic regimes: quality and efficiency driven, efficiency driven, quality driven, and nondegenerate slowdown. We prove that the approximation provides accurate estimates for a broad family of steady-state metrics. Our approach is “metric-free” in that we do not use the specific formulas for the steady-state distribution of the Erlang-A queue. Rather, we study excursions of the underlying birth-and-death process and couple these to properly defined excursions of the corresponding diffusion process. Regenerative process and martingale arguments, together with derivative bounds for solutions to certain ordinary differential equations, allow us to control the accuracy of the approximation. We demonstrate the appeal of universal approximation by studying two staffing optimization problems of practical interest.

To minimize staffing costs subject to service-level constraints, where we delicately balance the service levels (SLs) of the different classes, we propose a family of routing rules called fixed-queue-ratio (FQR) rules. With FQR, a newly available agent next serves the customer from the head of the queue of the class (from among those he is eligible to serve) whose queue length most exceeds a specified proportion of the total queue length. The proportions can be set to achieve desired SL targets. The FQR rule achieves an important state-space collapse (SSC) as the total arrival rate increases, in which the individual queue lengths evolve as fixed proportions of the total queue length. In the current paper we consider a variety of service-level types and exploit SSC to construct asymptotically optimal solutions for the staffing-and-routing problem. The key assumption in the current paper is that the service rates depend only on the agent pool.

The following question is addressed: How many servers are required (staffing) and how does one match them with customers (control) to minimize staffing cost, subject to class-level quality-of-service constraints? We tackle this question by characterizing scheduling and staffing schemes that are asymptotically optimal in the limit, as system load grows to infinity. The asymptotic regimes considered are consistent with the efficiency-driven (ED), quality-driven (QD), and quality-and-efficiency-driven (QED) regimes, first introduced in the context of a single-class service system. Our main findings are as follows: (a) Decoupling of staffing and control, namely, (i) staffing disregards the multiclass nature of the system and is analogous to the staffing of a single-class system with the same aggregate demand and a single global quality-of-service constraint, and (ii) class-level service differentiation is obtained by using a simple idle-server-based threshold-priority (ITP) control (with state-independent thresholds), and (b) robustness of the staffing and control rules: our proposed single-class staffing (SCS) rule and ITP control are approximately optimal under various problem formulations and model assumptions. Particularly, although our solution is shown to be asymptotically optimal for large systems, we numerically demonstrate that it performs well also for relatively small systems.

This paper considers a call center with cross-selling capability that serves a pool of customers that are differentiated in terms of their revenue potential and delay sensitivity. It studies the operational decisions of staffing, call routing, and cross-selling under various forms of customer segmentation. It derives near-optimal controls in each of the settings analyzed, and characterizes the impact of a more refined customer segmentation on the structure of these policies and the center's profitability.

A newly available server serves the customer from the head of the queue of the class (from among those the server is eligible to serve) whose queue length most exceeds a specified proportion of the total queue length. Under fairly general conditions, QIR produces an important state-space collapse as the total arrival rate and the numbers of servers increase in a coordinated way. That state-space collapse was previously used to delicately balance service levels for the different customer classes. In this sequel, we show that a special version of QIR stochastically minimizes convex holding costs in a finite-horizon setting when the service rates are restricted to be pool dependent. Under additional regularity conditions, the special version of QIR reduces to a simple policy: linear costs produce a priority-type rule, in which the least-cost customers are given low priority. Strictly convex costs (plus other regularity conditions) produce a many-server analogue of the generalized-cμ (Gcμ) rule, under which a newly available server selects a customer from the class experiencing the greatest marginal cost at that time.

The arrival process is periodic Poisson. The service time of a customer has components in different time scales: length of stay (LOS) in days and departure time (hdis) in hours. This queueing system has been used to study patient flows from the emergency department (ED) to hospital inpatient wards. In that setting, the LOS of a patient is simply the number of days she spends in a ward, and her departure time hdis is the discharge hour on the day of her discharge. We develop a new analytical framework that can perform exact analysis on this novel queueing system. This framework has two steps: first analyze the midnight customer count process and obtain its stationary distribution, then analyze the time-dependent customer count process to compute various performance measures. We also develop approximation tools that can significantly reduce the computational time. In particular, via Stein’s method, we derive explicit expressions to approximate the stationary distribution of the midnight count. We provide error bounds for these approximations and numerically demonstrate that they are remarkably accurate for systems with various sizes and load conditions. Our theoretical and numerical analysis have produced a number of insights that can be used to improve hospital inpatient flow management. We find that the LOS term affects the overnight wait caused by the mismatch between daily arrivals and discharges, whereas the hdis term affects the intraday wait caused by the nonsynchronization between the arrival and discharge time patterns. Thus, reducing LOS or increasing capacity can impact the daily average performance significantly, shifting the discharge timing to earlier times of a day can alleviate the peak congestion in the morning and mainly affects the time-dependent performance.

Customer service times are assumed to be exponentially distributed. We study the asymptotic behavior of these queueing systems in a heavy traffic regime that is known as the Halfin-Whitt many-server asymptotic regime. Our main contribution is a general framework for establishing state space collapse results in this regime for parallel server systems. In our work, state space collapse refers to a decrease in the dimension of the processes tracking the number of customers in each class waiting for service and the number of customers in each class being served by various server pools. We define and introduce a “state space collapse” function, which governs the exact details of the state space collapse. We show that a state space collapse result holds in many-server heavy traffic if a corresponding deterministic hydrodynamic model satisfies a similar state space collapse condition. Unlike the single-server heavy traffic setting for multiclass queueing network, our hydrodynamic model is different from the standard fluid model for many-server queues. Our methodology is similar in spirit to that in Bramson [Bramson, M. 1998. State space collapse with application to heavy traffic limits for multiclass queueing networks. Queueing Systems30 89–148.], which focuses on the single-server heavy traffic regime. We illustrate the applications of our results by establishing state space collapse results in many-server diffusion limits for V-model systems under static-buffer-priority policy and the threshold policy proposed in the literature.

The problem is related to several important service settings such as call centers and emergency departments where the customers are grouped into two classes of “high priority” and “low priority,” and the services are typically evaluated according to the proportion of customers who are responded to within targeted response times. To date, only approximation methods have been explored to generate staffing requirements for time-dependent dual-class services, but we propose a tractable numerical approach to evaluate system behavior and generate safe minimum staffing levels using mixed discrete-continuous time Markov chains (MDCTMCs). Our approach is delicate in that it accounts for the behavior of the system under a number of different rules that may be imposed on staff if they are busy when due to leave and involves explicitly calculating delay distributions for two customer classes. Ultimately, we embed our methodology in a proposed extension of the Euler method, coined Euler Pri, that can cope with two customer classes, and use it to recommend staffing levels for the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust (WAST).

By means of queuing and simulation analysis, we show that the detrimental effects of pooling (cross-training) previously found in single resource constrained (SRC) heterogeneous systems are also apparent in DRC heterogeneous systems. Fully cross-training workers in DRC heterogeneous systems is only beneficial if the differences between mean processing times are not too large, otherwise cross-training should be pursued within homogeneous subgroups of machines. Due to the limited machine availability, DRC systems are unable to use some of the potential assignment flexibility from cross-trained workers (pooled queues) that can be used in SRC systems. However, it appears that this restriction in the DRC system may even improve the system mean flow (waiting) time performance compared to the SRC system for relatively large differences in processing time. Finally, in fully flexible multiple server queuing systems, restricting the assignment flexibility by applying a decentral when-rule (i.e. a commonly used labour assignment rule in practice and research) instead of a central when-rule also seems to improve the mean flow time performance under processing time differences.

The metamodel type determines the design of the simulation experiment, which determines the input combinations of the simulation model. Before applying these metamodels, the analysts should screen the many inputs of a realistic simulation model, this contribution focuses on sequential bifurcation. Optimization of the simulated system may use either a sequence of first-order and second-order polynomials—so-called response surface methodology (RSM)—or Kriging models fitted through sequential designs—including efficient global optimization (EGO).

Subway companies typically deal with a highly variable demand for fares, several operational requirements, and increasing service expectations from users. In this paper, we describe a simulation-optimization method for fare-collection shift scheduling in a subway network. We use an integer programming model to generate shift schedules and a discrete-event simulation model to evaluate the corresponding service levels in terms of the average number of users waiting in line over time. If the expected service level at a particular station booth does not meet a predefined service standard, then our method automatically generates an additional constraint on the number of fare collectors at that station booth. The proposed approach iteratively adds this new constraint to the integer programming model until either the current schedule meets the service standard or the problem becomes infeasible. We use the proposed solution approach to solve the fare-collection shift-scheduling problem faced by one of the largest subway companies in Latin America, Metro de Santiago in Chile. The resulting shift schedules show a significant improvement compared with Metro’s previous scheduling practice in terms of service levels, operational costs, capacity utilization, and solution times.

Hospital inpatient units dynamically adjust premium staffing (above base staffing) levels by attempting to match their daily demand. Historically, inpatient managers subjectively adjust daily staffing from observing the morning inpatient inventory. Inpatient units strive to match staff with demand in a complex patient throughput environment where service rates and non-stationary profiles are not explicitly known. Related queue control and throughput modeling literature do not directly match staffing with demand, require explicit service process knowledge, and are not formulated for an inpatient unit. This paper presents a Markov decision process (MDP) for dynamic inpatient staffing. The MDP explicitly attempts to match staffing with demand, has a statistical discrete time Markov chain foundation that estimates the service process, predicts transient inventory, and is formulated for an inpatient unit. Lastly, the MDP application to a telemetry unit reveals a computational myopic, an approximate stationary, and a finite horizon optimal policy that is validated through hospital expert experience. The application reveals difficult-to-staff inventory levels and shows that the removal of discharge seasonality can drastically decrease required size of the premium staffing pool and the probability of full occupancy thus improving the inpatient unit's patient flow.

The authors performed a rather extensive overview, review, and discussion of quality-related literature since 1995. They used centering resonance analysis (CRA), which has not been previously utilized in the quality management literature, to analyze 1978 research articles to identify influential word pairings in the literature overall, and in 251 articles appearing in recognized “A” journals.

Density forecasts of arrival rates are needed for analytical call center models, which assume Poisson arrivals with a stochastic arrival rate. Density forecasts of call volumes can be used in simulation models and are also important for the analysis of outsourcing contracts. A forecasting method, which has previously shown strong potential, is Holt–Winters exponential smoothing adapted for modeling the intraday and intraweek cycles in intraday data. To enable density forecasting of the arrival volume and rate, we develop a Poisson count model, with gamma distributed arrival rate, which captures the essential features of this exponential smoothing method. The apparent stationary level in our data leads us to develop versions of the new model for series with stationary levels. We evaluate forecast accuracy up to two weeks ahead using data from three organizations. We find that the stationary level models improve prediction beyond approximately two days ahead, and that these models perform well in comparison with sophisticated benchmarks. This is confirmed by the results of a call center simulation model, which demonstrates the use of arrival rate density forecasting to support staffing decisions.

Using a field experiment with random assignment to training combined with survey information on workers' reciprocal inclinations, the results show that reciprocal workers reciprocate employers' training investments by higher posttraining performance. This result, which is robust to controlling for observed personality traits and worker fixed effects, suggests that individuals reciprocate the firm's human capital investment with higher effort, in line with theoretical models on gift exchange in the workplace. This finding provides an alternative rationale to explain firm training investments even with the risk of poaching.

This chapter focuses on reviewing global recruiting research in three main areas: internal global recruitment, external global recruitment and global relocation. It considers how different types of global assignments, various recruitment activities, individual differences and parent, host and third country factors influence global recruitment outcomes. The chapter highlights that global recruitment systems and associated outcomes are influenced by a variety of factors that span multiple levels of analysis and propose ideas for future research directions. Research on sourcing or identifying high potential talent, desired characteristics to target and external recruiting strategies for attracting internationally mobile talent, is considered. Global recruitment is at the dawn of an increasingly important era of research and practice because it is a foundation for global talent management strategies.

The aim is to take short-term variability and correlations in time for call arrivals at such a vendor call center into account. To do so, peakedness is proposed as a useful measure of the burstiness in the arrival stream. The study empirically demonstrates the presence of bursty arrivals at a call center and proposes an approach to the measurement of the peakedness of the arrival stream making use of standard call center data. The problematic nature of bursty arrivals in the context of call center co-sourcing is demonstrated along with an asymptotic result establishing that the problem persists in large call centers. The study then analyzes two peakedness-based staffing methods: one which is a well known extension of the square root staffing rule and another which makes use of the Hayward approximation principles. Both approaches are simple and enable the vendor to improve its staffing procedure with good accuracy.

We construct models for profit and cost centers using dynamic rate queues. To allow for practical optimal controls, we approximate the queueing process using a Gaussian random variable with equal mean and variance. We then appeal to the Pontryagin's maximum principle to derive a closed form square root staffing (SRS) rule for optimal staffing. Unlike most traditional SRS formulas, the main parameter in our formula is not the probability of delay but rather a cost-to-benefit ratio that depends on the shadow price. We show that the delay experienced by customers can be interpreted in terms of this ratio. Throughout the article, we provide theoretical support of our analysis and conduct extensive numerical experiments to reinforce our findings. To this end, various scenarios are considered to evaluate the change in the staffing levels as the cost-to-benefit ratio changes. We also assess the change in the service grade and the effects of a service-level agreement constraint. Our analysis indicates that the variation in the ratio of customer abandonment over service rate particularly influences staffing levels and can lead to drastically different policies between profit and cost service centers. Our main contribution is the introduction of new analysis and managerial insights into the nonstationary optimal staffing of service centers, especially when the objective is to maximize profitability. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In such systems, customers typically hang up and abandon the system if their wait for service is too long. Such abandonments are detrimental for the system, and so managers typically use scheduling as a tool to mitigate it. In this paper, we study the interplay between customer impatience and scheduling decisions when managing heterogeneous customer classes. Academic/practical relevance: Call centers constitute a large industry that has a global spending of around $300 billion and employs more than 15 million people worldwide. Our work focuses on improving call center operations, which can reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction. Mathematically, customer patience is typically modeled as exponentially distributed for tractability. Our work makes inroads into relaxing this restrictive assumption to allow modeling more realistic call center situations. Methodology: We use heavy traffic–motivated asymptotic queueing machinery that provides us the traction to successfully capture and incorporate the customer impatience distribution into the scheduling problem. In our approach, the scheduling problem reduces to a diffusion control problem, which we solve to propose near-optimal scheduling policies. Results: We propose near-optimal scheduling policies that can be implemented by call centers to improve their quality-of-service metrics. One of our main results is that, for a class of parameters, we establish sufficient conditions for both the optimality and nonoptimality of threshold policies. Managerial implications: Threshold policies are widely used for scheduling. Our work provides additional insight into whether these may be suboptimal. Our work provides an easy-to-implement alternative that can reduce customer abandonments considerably, for instance, our numerical results indicate that for a system with two customer types, the abandonment rate of one class can be lowered by 30% by using our policy relative to the best threshold policy.

We present a transformation from a PAND gate to an AND gate with some dependent conditioning events, called CAND gate, provided that the dynamic behavior of the system can be modeled by a (semi-)Markov process. With the CAND transformation, the qualitative analysis of a PFT can be reduced from a permutation problem into a combinatorial problem without resorting to the concept of minimal cut sequence. In addition, we discover that the PAND gate cannot model the priority relations between the events whose occurrences are not necessary for the output event. The inability of the PAND gate can be overcome by the proposed CAND gate.

China has just entered the second half of the Middle period of industrialization, and the emerging service industries are ready to thrive just like buds waiting to bloom although China is still at the initial stage. At present, the development of service economy is typically characterized by the progress and application of modern information technology, which results in the significant feature of information for the emerging service industries. With the speed of development, development potential and importance as the criteria for selection, this chapter delves into the application of service science to the emerging service industries by analyzing such typical industries as express delivery, call center and service-oriented manufacturing: China boasts a large population and a vast territory and features increasingly frequent market trades, thus posing a tremendous demand for the industry of express delivery. Moreover, the fast development of E-commerce since the new century stimulates the rapid expansion of demand for express delivery in China, which has become a major pillar sector for online economy, with the development of communication technology and the increasing importance of the customer service function for enterprises, call centers, transferring intangible services relying on communication technology, have been springing up like mushrooms, on the one hand developing into an indispensable auxiliary role for the development of other service industries and on the other hand gradually evolving into an independent emerging industry. Presently, China is still in the process of industrialization and has not entered the era of service economy. The manufacturing industry plays a pivot role in the national economy despite the rapid development of the service sector. The transformation of the manufacturing industry into service industry accounts for an important part of China’s industrialization process, giving a powerful impetus to the development of service economy. Different from the traditional service industries, service-oriented manufacturing is more than simple manufacturing and in this book, an independent introduction will be provided by treating it as an emerging service industry.

In the second part of this paper, we review applications of simulation optimization in various contexts, with detailed discussions on health care, logistics, and manufacturing systems. Finally, we explore the potential of simulation optimization in the new era. Specifically, we discuss how simulation optimization can benefit from cloud computing and high-performance computing, its integration with big data analytics, and the value of simulation optimization to help address challenges in engineering design of complex systems.

Understanding the trend of outbound spam can help organizations adopt proactive policies and measures toward a more informed decision on resource allocation in terms of security investment. This can also facilitate governments in designing incentive mechanisms such as cyber insurance. Using three years of daily spam volume from the United States, this research investigates the distribution of daily volume and compare univariate time series methods for forecasting. The methods explored include various exponential smoothing methods, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and neutral network auto-regressive (NNAR) modeling. Our evaluation of multiple univariate time series models suggests that Holt’s linear trend models based on exponential smoothing and neural network modeling can lead to more accurate spam prediction. The conclusion and implications are discussed.

High utilization can improve financial performance, but causes congestion, which increases throughput time. Employees may manage this trade-off by reducing processing times during periods of high workload, resulting in an inverted U-shaped relationship between utilization and throughput time. Using two years of inpatient data from 203 California hospitals, we find evidence that patient length of stay (LOS) increases as occupancy increases, until a tipping point, after which patients are discharged early to alleviate congestion. More interestingly, we find a second tipping point—at 93% occupancy—beyond which additional occupancy leads to a longer LOS. These results are indicative of a workload-related “saturation effect” where employees can no longer overcome high workload by speeding up. Our data suggest that the saturation effect is due to an increase in the workload requirements of the remaining patients. Collectively, we find that the underlying relationship between occupancy and LOS is N-shaped. Consequently, managers who seek cost efficiencies via a strategy of high utilization in tandem with speeding up may find that their strategy backfires because there is a point at which employees are no longer able to compensate for a high workload by working harder, and throughput time counterproductively increases. We perform a counterfactual analysis and find that an alternate strategy of employing flexible labor when faced with high occupancy levels might be a more productive approach, and could save the hospitals in our sample up to $138 million over 23 months.

It is modeled as a set of heterogeneous restless multiarmed bandit problems (RMABPs) connected by constraints imposed by resource capacity. Following Whittle’s relaxation idea and Weber and Weiss’ asymptotic optimality proof, we propose a simple policy and prove it to be asymptotically optimal in a regime where both arrival rates and capacities increase. We provide a simple sufficient condition for asymptotic optimality of the policy and, in complete generality, propose a method that generates a set of candidate policies for which asymptotic optimality can be checked. The effectiveness of these results is demonstrated by numerical experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work providing asymptotic optimality results for such a resource allocation problem and such a combination of multiple RMABPs.

The effective improvement of such pooling system can be achieved by reducing the resource idleness in case of congestion. In this paper, we model both the service provider and the cooperative coalition as a single server queue. We attempt to answer the following questions: (i) which coalition strategy should be used, and (ii) which allocation rule should be selected in order to maintain the stability of the coalition? In particular, we consider the service pooling with a fixed service capacity for M/G/1 service systems. The benefit of the pooling system is due to the shortened waiting queue in the overall system. We develop the corresponding cooperative game with transferable utility, and analyze the core allocations. Although it is difficult to express a core allocation explicitly for the game, we prove the non-emptiness of the core. We give a reasonable expression of Equal Profit Method to distribute the cost for our game, and investigate a number of cost allocation rules under three typical situations to evaluate the gain of the service pooling strategy for each service provider. The numerical results show that the cost allocation rule proposed gives a reasonable cost-sharing result considering the contribution of each participant.

We show that the average waiting time can be reduced through strategically allocating the rates of service and retrial times without needing additional service capacity. Countering to the intuition that higher service variability usually yields a larger delay, we show that the benefits of our simultaneous service-and-retrial differentiation policy outweigh the impact of the increased service variability. We present a necessary and sufficient condition under which the proposed policy reduces the waiting time and a closed-form expression for the optimal allocation policy. In heavy traffic, our policy can asymptotically reduce both the delay and the number of customer retrials before entering service by a significant factor, which is a function of the ratio of the service rate to the retrial rate.

However, within a service delivery context, enterprise clients are demanding predictive analytics that outline future “costs” associated with changing conditions. The service delivery staffing costs incurred in addressing problems and requests (arriving in the form of incident and other problem tickets) in the managed environment is especially of high importance. This paper describes an analytical study addressing such cost prediction. Specifically, a novel approach is described in which support vector regression is used to predict service delivery workloads (measured by ticket volumes) based on managed server characteristics Additionally, a proposed framework combining various analytical models is proposed to predict service delivery staffing requirements under changing IT infrastructure characteristics and conditions. Detailed descriptions of the workload prediction techniques, as well as an evaluation using data from an actual large service delivery engagement, are presented.

We consider the problem of spatially and temporally optimizing the allocation of law enforcement resources such that the quality of service (QoS) in terms of emergency response time can be guaranteed. To solve this problem, we provide a spatio-temporal MILP optimization model, which we learn from a real-world dataset of incidents and dispatching records, and solve by existing solvers. One key feature of our proposed model is the introduction of risk values that allow a planner to flexibly make a tradeoff between their resource budget and the targeted service quality. Experimental results on real-world incident data, and simulations run on learned synthetic data, show a significant reduction in resource requirements over current practice, with violating QoS or abusing resource utilization.

In today's economy, call centers have become the primary points of contact between customers and businesses. Thus accurate predictions of call arrival rates are indispensable to help call center practitioners staff their call centers efficiently and cost-effectively. This article proposes a multiplicative model for modeling and forecasting within-day arrival rates to a U.S. commercial bank's call center. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods are used to estimate both latent states and model parameters. One-day-ahead density forecasts for the rates and counts are provided. The calibration of these predictive distributions is evaluated through probability integral transforms. Furthermore, 1-day-ahead forecasts comparisons with classical statistical models are given. Our predictions show significant improvements of up to 25% over these standards. A sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is also proposed for sequential estimation and forecasts of the model parameters and rates.

This research begins to address these implications by studying the relationship between offshoring and customer satisfaction, expressed through the American Customer Satisfaction Index™ tracked by the National Quality Research Center. We analyze panel data of 68 firms and business units from 1997-2004, and find that offshoring is associated with an increase in both perceived value and perceived quality, the two key components of customer satisfaction. We also find that the positive relationship between offshoring and customer satisfaction is mediated by both perceived value and perceived quality. This indicates that as firms engage in offshoring IT and business processes, firms simultaneously increase the value and quality of their goods and services.

However, the methods taken by firms around recruitment, training and management of overseas call centre agents have been far more complex, leading to high failure rates with Call Centre Offshoring (CCO) practices. To better understand the current CCO practices, this study reviews a current research status. Through a literature review, we identified a number of themes spanning across disciplines related to CCO. We found that the current literature lacked of understanding of socio-cultural elements such as trust, language, communication, national and organisational culture that positively influenced the stakeholder relationships. We argue that a common link can be established among CCO-related studies across disciplines when approaching the topic from a socio-cultural perspective. Our findings discuss the implications and provide a useful reference for future CCO-related studies.

In this paper, we investigate whether this is rational behavior on the part of the call center and what the implications are for customers. In particular, we show that under contracts on the percentile of delay, which are commonly used in the call center industry, this is rational behavior, at least under the approximating asymptotic regime considered in this paper. We then suggest other contracts that do not result in this type of undesirable behavior from a contract customer's perspective. We compare the performance of the different contracts in terms of mean, variance, and outer percentiles of delay for both customer types using both numerical and asymptotic heavy-traffic analyses. We argue that including terms reflecting the second moment of delay in a contract would be beneficial to contract customers and, in a sense, fairer.

A distinctive feature of the service centers based on IM is that one agent can serve multiple customers in parallel. We choose to model such a center as a server pool consisting of many limited processor-sharing servers. We characterize the underlying stochastic processes by establishing a fluid approximation in the many-server heavy-traffic regime. The limiting behavior of the stochastic processes is shown to involve a stochastic averaging principle, and the fluid approximation provides insights into the optimal staffing and control for such service centers.

Through a service provision strategy matrix based on the question of who is better off by undertaking the service provision, we develop a model of two heterogeneous competitive retailers selling an identical product produced by one manufacturer, and obtain several managerial insights. For instance, we find that the service provision always generates two potential effects: a positive “demand expansion effect” and a negative “service cost effect.” The favored retailer always benefits from the demand expansion effect. However, the disfavored retailer does not always benefit from service provision even if the negative service cost effect is transferred through service outsourcing. If the interretailer competition is not very fierce and the two retailers have similar initial market sizes, service outsourcing yields a win–win situation. Interestingly, we identify that two retailers adopting the retailer-provided service is a classic Prisoner's dilemma. Furthermore, we also examine the manufacturer's response and find that the manufacturer obtains a profit when the retailers outsource services. Counter-intuitively, the manufacturer has an incentive to reject service outsourcing since the retailer-provided service can bring more profits. Surprisingly, this initiative rejection strategy always forces the retailers into different Prisoner's dilemmas and decrease the channel efficiency. Furthermore, we discuss some extensions to prove the robustness of our main qualitative insights.

A vital input to build simulation models of manufacturing systems is the system behaviour, which is modelled based on extensive data on manufacturing systems and their elements. However, for outsourced manufacturing systems, data provided from external suppliers to manufacturers are generally limited and insufficient. Therefore, a solution is required to identify and secure system behaviour from available data. We propose herein a behaviour extraction process along with detailed activities and diagrams to extract system behaviour from limited data. By using the systems engineering standard ANSI/EIA-632, the proposed process systematically restructures available data on a manufacturing system and its elements and then provides complete system behaviour to build a simulation model. A case study on a cooling water control system in a hot strip mill convincingly demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed process.

Abandonment data collected by TQs is interval censored, which makes predicting customer abandonments a challenging problem. In this paper, we build a Bayesian framework for predicting abandonment counts in TQs to assist managers in workforce planning. In doing so, we propose parametric and semiparametric modulated Poisson process models and develop their Bayesian analyses using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We implement our models using actual abandonment data from a bank's TQ, and illustrate how we can provide managerial insights related to abandonment counts and server allocation policies.

Such processes require specification of intensity (arrival rate) functions, which are typically defined in a parametric form. The accuracy of the parametric models is highly sensitive to the choice of the specific intensity function for the arrival process. We use a Bayesian framework by proposing a nonparametric form for the intensity function and introduce a robust semiparametric model. The model is suitable for analyzing both time of arrival data and interval censored count data and can capture both monotonic and non-monotonic arrival intensity. The intensity function in the model can be modulated to incorporate auxiliary information as well as seasonal and random effect components. We develop the Bayesian analysis of the proposed model and implement it on two real call center datasets with different characteristics. We also consider several extensions to our model and develop their Bayesian analyses. Our random effects extension model with cumulative baseline intensity changing on the days of the week and interday correlation with the Markov evolution extension model both provide high predictive accuracy. We also show that our proposed semiparametric model has robust performance for out-of-sample predictions. Accurate predictions of arrivals will assist managers in determining appropriate staffing levels and effective workforce scheduling, resulting in more efficient operations.

We model MSS as a collaborative service with the protection quality shaped by the contribution of both the service provider and the client. We adopt the negligence concept from the legal profession to design two novel contracts: threshold-based liability contract and variable liability contract. We find that they can achieve the first best outcome when postbreach effort verification is feasible. More importantly, they are more efficient than a multilateral contract when the MSS provider assumes limited liability. Our results show that bilateral liability-based contracts can work in the real world. Hence, more research is needed to explore their properties. We discuss the related implications.

Traditional staffing methods are static, hence do not react well to surges in patient demands. We study strategies that intelligently adjust the number of doctors based on current and historical information about the patient arrival. Our main contribution is our proposed data-driven online approach that performs adaptive allocation by utilizing historical as well as current arrivals by running symbiotic simulation in real-time. We build a simulation prototype that models ED process that is close to real-world with time-varying demand and re-entrant patients. The experimental results show that our approach allows the ED to better cope with demand surges and to meet a service level desired by the hospital.

However, the existing concepts and methods for individual tasks cannot be fully applied to the research of the dispatching team task of OCC. In view of the research status, this work analyzed the characteristics of the dispatching team task complexity (TTC) in OCC and developed a network-based model of dispatching team task. Based on the team task network model, a three-dimension conceptual model of TTC for dispatching team task in OCC was finally constructed in the paper using an induction method. Three kinds of emergency tasks also verified the effectiveness of the proposed three-dimension conceptual model.

Using individual-level data from a U.S.-based health insurance firm, we model a customer’s query frequency and choice of using the telephone or web channel for resolving queries as a stochastic function of her latent “information stock.” The information stock is a function of the customer’s “information needs” (which arise when customers file health insurance claims) and “information gains” (which customers obtain when they resolve their queries through the telephone and web support channels), and other factors such as seasonal effects (for instance, queries that arise at the time of annual contract renewal). We find that average information gain from a telephone call is twice as much as that from visiting the web portal, customers prefer the telephone channel for health event-related information but prefer the web portal for structured seasonal information, and customers are polarized in their propensities of using the web channel and can be broadly classified into “web avoiders” and “web seekers.” Our model provides superior in-sample and out-of-sample fit than multiple benchmark models for aggregate and individual-level customer activity and has several managerial uses, such as capacity planning.

Traditionally, rework is assigned back to the agent who generates the defect (in a self-routing scheme) or to another agent dedicated to rework (in a dedicated routing scheme). In contrast, a novel cross-routing scheme allocates rework to a parallel agent performing both new jobs and rework. The agent who passes quality inspection or completes rework receives the piece rate paid per job. We compare the incentives of these rework-allocation schemes in a principal-agent model with embedded quality control and routing in a multiclass queueing network. We show that conventional self-routing of rework cannot induce first-best effort. Dedicated routing and cross-routing, however, strengthen incentives for quality by imposing an implicit punishment for quality failure. In addition, cross-routing leads to workload-allocation externalities and a prisoner's dilemma, thereby creating the greatest incentives for quality. Firm profitability depends on demand levels, revenues, and quality costs. When the number of agents increases, the incentive effect of cross-routing reduces monotonically and approaches that of dedicated routing.

However, this approach makes the assumption that shifts will be filled with the same agents everyday, and ignores the practicalities of an actual call centre like day-offs, which would require shift assignments over longer time horizons. Moreover, many of these shift scheduling approaches use the arrival rate and service rate as inputs. This presents an issue because it might be difficult to estimate these rates with confidence from the data, especially the arrival rate which fluctuates during the day. We present a local search heuristic approach of assigning shifts and day-offs to existing call centre agents using hill climbing, tabu search, and simulated annealing. This is achieved without increasing the staffing costs. Our methods use individual calls data directly, therefore removing the need to estimate the arrival rate, and minimising the need to estimate the service rate. The methods are applied to real-life data from a call centre and the results show improvements in the achieved service level and a significant drop in the number of abandoned calls.

Analyzing these systems is not straightforward, because standard queueing theory focuses on the long-run steady-state behavior of stationary models. We show how to adapt stationary queueing models for use in nonstationary environments so that time-dependent performance is captured and staffing requirements can be set. Relatively little modification of straightforward stationary analysis applies in systems where service times are short and the targeted quality of service is high. When service times are moderate and the targeted quality of service is still high, time-lag refinements can improve traditional stationary independent period-by-period and peak-hour approximations. Time-varying infinite-server models help develop refinements, because closed-form expressions exist for their time-dependent behavior. More difficult cases with very long service times and other complicated features, such as end-of-day effects, can often be treated by a modified-offered-load approximation, which is based on an associated infinite-server model. Numerical algorithms and deterministic fluid models are useful when the system is overloaded for an extensive period of time. Our discussion focuses on telephone call centers, but applications to police patrol, banking, and hospital emergency rooms are also mentioned.

While human factor texts provide some insights into basic performance issues, the emergence of highly automated computing systems have fundamentally altered the way humans work. The purpose of this paper is to present an approach to quantify and analyze human performance in human-in-the-loop simulations based on over ten years of research experience. The approach is centered on a measurement construct, called a time window, which enables a functional relationship between constraints on operator activities and time availability. A blackboard model is presented as the mechanism to generate, maintain, and complete time windows. To demonstrate the utility of time windows, an existing implementation in a real-time human-in-the-loop simulation is also described. An extension of time windows to measure team performance is also discussed. Using time window outcomes, samples of previous analyses are presented to exhibit the potential of the construct.

This process is experimental and the keywords may be updated as the learning algorithm improves.

However, there is little evidence on how the implementation of AI systems impacts customer behavior as well as the effect of AI systems on call center performance. Using data from a natural field experiment, we examine how the introduction of voice-based AI in a large telecommunication services call center affects call length, customers’ demands for human service, and customer complaints. We find that the implementation of AI significantly increases call length and decreases customer complaints. Although presumably the AI-enhanced service system reduces users’ efforts to transfer to human agents, we do not find a significant increase in customers’ demands for human service. In addition, regarding simple service tasks, the AI-enhanced service system reduces customer complaints for both experienced and inexperienced customers. For relatively complex tasks, customers learn from prior experience of interacting with the AI system, as this learning effect leads to the decrease of complaints. What’s more, our results suggest significant heterogeneity in the effects of the AI-enhanced service system by indicating that the AI-enhanced system has a significantly larger effect on reducing customer complaints for older and female customers as well as for the customers who are experienced in using the IVR system.

They compare performance during a period against a contracted service level and penalize outcomes exceeding some allowed deviation. SLAs have a number of design characteristics that need careful tuning to ensure that incentives are properly aligned. However, there is little theoretical research in this area. Using an example of an SLA for outsourcing inventory management, we make a number of recommendations. First it is preferable, if possible, that penalties be proportional to the underperformance rather than lump-sum ones. This goes a long way towards mitigating strategic (“gaming”) behavior by the supplier. Second, it might be thought that giving “bonuses for good performance” rather than “penalties for bad performance” are essentially identical apart from the former being a more positive approach to management. This turns out to be incorrect in the case of large percentage service rate targets and that penalties will normally be preferred by the buying firm. Third, in order not to incorrectly penalize underperformance resulting purely from “noise” rather than supplier efforts, management might think it best to make allowed deviations from the target generous. Again intuition is not a helpful guide here: for proportional penalties, acceptable performance deviations should be close to the target. Although these results come from a particular inventory application, it is likely that the lessons are applicable to SLAs in general.

First the features' sensitivity to the group-difference and the correlation to the clinical HAMD scale score were analyzed, and then the classification method was used to further test the role of the resting EEG features in depression. The results showed that the difference between depression and healthy controls in the absolute power of beta band in the left prefrontal lobe was significant. And the alpha left-right asymmetry in the prefrontal cortex had a correlation with HAMD scale score. In addition, the classification based on the features showed that there was a relative higher accuracy rate to identify the depressions than to identify the healthy controls. Specifically, the classification based on alpha asymmetry was higher than that based on beta asymmetry, and the absolute power in beta band was higher than that in alpha band. Alpha asymmetry is a traditional sensitive resting EEG features for depression, this study provide new evidence to support the view. The findings here further suggest that absolute power in beta band would be important biomarker in depression.

In this problem setting, the call traffic should be predicted in a long-term way where the forecasting results for different periods are required. However, it is very challenging to solve this problem due to the randomness nature of the call traffic and the multiple forecasting in long term. Current methods cannot solve this problem since they either merely focus on short-term forecasting for the next hour or next day, or ignore call-holding time for call traffic prediction. In this paper, we propose an effective method for predicting long-term call traffic with multiple forecasting results for different future periods, e.g., every 15 min, and take both call arrival rate and call-holding time into consideration through the Erlang. In our method, the seasonal dependencies are summarized by performing data analysis, then different features based on these dependencies are extracted for training the prediction model.In order to forecast call traffic of multiple time buckets, we propose two strategies based on different features. The evaluation results show that the features, the prediction models and the strategies are feasible. Keywords Long-term Multiple Call traffic Forecasting Seasonal dependence

In particular, one of the customer classes is considered urgent, and is therefore prioritized over the other class, further, the average service time of customers from the urgent class is significantly larger than that of the nonurgent class. We therefore refer to the urgent class as “slow,” and to the nonurgent class as “fast.” Due to the complexity and intractability of the system’s dynamics, our goal is to develop and analyze an asymptotic approximation, which captures the prevalent fact that, in practice, customers from both classes are likely to experience delays before entering service. However, under existing many-server limiting regimes, only two of the following options can be captured in the limit: (i) either the customers from the prioritized (slow) customer class do not wait at all, or (ii) the fast-class customers do not receive any service. We therefore propose a novel Fluid-Diffusion Hybrid (FDH) many-server asymptotic regime, under which the queue of the slow class behaves like a diffusion limit, whereas the queue of the fast class evolves as a (random) fluid limit that is driven by the diffusion process. That FDH limit is achieved by assuming that the service rate of the fast class scales with the system’s size, whereas the service rate of the slow class is kept fixed. Numerical examples demonstrate that our FDH limit is accurate when the difference between the service rates of the two classes is sufficiently large. We then employ the FDH approximation to study the costs and benefits of de-pooling the service pool, by reserving a small number of servers for the fast class. We prove that, in some cases, a two-pool structure is the asymptotically optimal system design.

Based on an extensive range of numerical examples, we quantify how the flow control policy of bringing arrival rates more in line with available capacity affects customer-oriented metrics and measures of efficiency in service capacity resources. We also quantify the expectations that the policy would place on arriving customers. How these quantitative outcomes are influenced by contextual parameters such as the pattern of customer arrivals and the tightness of capacity constraints is also clarified.

Customers calling are impatient, hence phone requests have a higher priority over e-mail messages. E-mails that are not responded to within a specified time limit can be prioritized. The goal of this paper is to assess the performance improvement via cross-training the agents. The performance of contact centers operated under different strategies are compared. An extensive simulation study is presented that shows that strategies permitting pre-emptive-resume policies provide the best performance for phone calls. The results also demonstrate that limited cross-training with two skills per agent results in considerable performance improvements. However, the unbalanced traffic intensities due to different mean service times for each class necessitate more cross-training at three skills per agent to have considerable improvement.

In many industries, service level-based supply contracts are commonly used. Under such a contract, a company agrees to achieve a certain service level and to pay a financial penalty if it misses it. The service level used in our study refers to the fraction of a manufacturer's demand filled by the supplier. We analyze two types of service level-based supply contracts that are designed by a manufacturer and offered to a supplier. The first type of contract is a flat penalty contract, under which the supplier pays a fixed penalty to the manufacturer in each period in which the contract service level is not achieved. The second type of contract is a unit penalty contract, under which a penalty is due for each unit delivered fewer than specified by the parameters of the contract. We show how the supplier responds to the contracts and how the contract parameters can be chosen, such that the supply chain is coordinated. We also derive structural results about optimal values of the contract parameters, provide numerical results, and connect our service level measures to traditional service level measures. The results of our analyses can be used by decision makers to design optimal service level contracts and to provide them with a solid foundation for contract negotiations.

The workload of such fleets usually cannot be forecasted with certainty and its urgency requires an immediate response. However, prolonged focused work periods decrease efficiency with related decline of attention and performance. Therefore, break schedule should be regularly updated as the work shift progresses to allow frequent and sufficiently long time for rest. In this paper, we propose a distributed and dynamic work break scheduling algorithm for crews in emergency service vehicle fleets. Based on the historical intervention data, the algorithm rearranges vehicles’ crews’ work breaks in a manner considering individual crews’ preferences. Moreover, it dynamically reallocates stand-by vehicles for best coverage of a region of interest. We analyze the proposed algorithm and show its performance and efficiency on the EMS use-case.

Analogously, specialized teams of servers handle the base-load of transactions every day, and the in-house or outsourced peaker team services the peak-load demand. We study how peaker ownership choice and cost and profit optimizing behavior influence optimal peaker architecture (outsourcing and capacity decisions).

PrincipalAgent Theory and Performance-Based Contracting in the Coast Guards Deepwater Modernization Program;International Journal of Public Administration;https://doi.org/10.1080/01900692.2018.1439061;14;tandfonline;ren_zhou_et_al_2008;True;0190-0692;C;ABSTRACT In the mid-1990s, the United States Coast Guard began planning a modernization effort known as the Deepwater program to replace an aging inventory of cutters, aircraft, and small boats. This effort involved a consortium of corporations to develop a “system of systems” to meet performance-based requirements and build the new equipment. This article examines the Deepwater program through the lens of multilayered principal–agent theory and evaluates the performance-based contracting (PBC) method used to alleviate strains linked to accountability from the principal–agent relationship. The findings help better understand the dilemmas prescribed from multilayered principal–agent theory and PBC by illustrating the accountability issues faced by smaller organizations when engaging in complex, large-scale procurement.

Academic/practical relevance: A knowledgeable retail sales associate (SA) can explain the features of available product variants and give a customer sufficient confidence in the customer’s choice or suggest alternatives so that the customer becomes willing to purchase. Although it is plausible that increasing an SA’s product knowledge will increase sales, training is not without cost and turnover is high in retail, so most retailers provide little product-knowledge training. Methodology: We partner with two firms and collect data on more than 50,000 SAs who had access to training. We assemble a detailed data set of the training history and individual sales productivity over a two-year period. We conduct econometric analysis to quantify the causal effect of training on sales. Results: For SAs who engaged in training, the sales rate increases by 1.8% for every online module taken, which is a much higher benefit than the direct or indirect costs associated with this training. Brand-specific training has a larger effect on the focal brand, however, there is a positive effect on other brands the SA sells. We also assess how the training benefit varies depending on the SA’s tenure, sales rate prior to training, and number of modules taken. Managerial implications: We present evidence of a novel training mechanism that can be extremely attractive to retailers. Online training tools, such as the one we study, have two characteristics that should not be overlooked. First, it is the brands, not the retailers, that create, develop, and pay for the training content. Second, the incentives are such that SAs invest their own time, rather than time on the job, to train, and this makes the retailer’s investment in the training a profitable proposition.

Specifically, we consider two queue design features: queue structure, which can be either parallel queues (multiple queues with a dedicated server per queue) or a single queue (a pooled queue served by multiple servers), and queue-length visibility, which can provide either full or blocked visibility. We find that (1) the single-queue structure slows down the servers, illustrating a drawback of pooling, and (2) poor visibility of the queue length slows down the servers, however, this effect may be mitigated, or even reversed, by pay schemes that incentivize the servers for fast performance. We provide additional managerial insights by isolating two behavioral drivers behind these results—task interdependence and saliency of feedback.

Although effective in reducing staffing level, hence labor cost, the potential impact of just-in-time scheduling on workers’ productivity and the firm’s revenue is not well understood. Using a data set of 1,444,044 transactions from 25 stores of a full-service casual dining restaurant chain in the United States, we study how just-in-time scheduling impacts worker productivity. We consider two types of just-in-time schedules: (1) short-notice schedules that are assigned to servers shortly before the day of service (mostly two days in our data) and (2) real-time schedules that are assigned to servers on the day of service. We show that short-notice schedules do not harm server productivity overall, but real-time schedules do by 4.4%. Our analysis indicates this may be because servers reduce their up-selling and cross-selling efforts when working on real-time schedules. We then propose an analytical scheduling model that accounts for both the value of staffing flexibility created through just-in-time scheduling and its impact on server productivity to inform the firm how to use just-in-time scheduling to improve profitability. Through a case study, we demonstrate that with the 4.4% productivity loss during the real-time schedules, the managers should shift from the heavy use of real-time scheduling toward scheduling more servers with longer advance notice. Such a shift not only provides more predictable work schedules for the workers but can also improve restaurants’ expected profit by up to 1%, a significant number for the low-margin restaurant industry.

It consists in determining the minimum-cost number of agents to be assigned to each shift of the scheduling horizon so as to reach the required customer quality of service. We assume that the mean call arrival rate in each period of the horizon is a random variable following a continuous distribution. We model the resulting optimization problem as a stochastic program involving joint probabilistic constraints. We propose a solution approach based on linear approximations to provide approximate solutions of the problem. We finally compare them with other approaches and give numerical results carried out on a real-life instance. These results show that the proposed approach compares well with previously published approaches both in terms of risk management and cost minimization.

In this work, we model the time series of Italian electricity consumption from 2004 to 2014 using an exponential smoothing approach. Data are observed hourly showing strong seasonal patterns at different frequencies as well as some calendar effects. We combine a parsimonious model representation of the intraday and intraweek cycles with an additional seasonal term that captures the monthly variability of the series. Irregular days, such as public holidays, are modelled separately by adding a specific exponential smoothing seasonal term. An additive ARMA error term is then introduced to lower the volatility of the estimated trend component and the residuals’ autocorrelation. The forecasting exercise demonstrates that the proposed model performs remarkably well, in terms of lower root mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error criteria, in both short term and medium term forecasting horizons.

Prior research on coordination in temporary groups describes how roles encode individual responsibilities so that coordination between relative strangers is possible. We extend this research by introducing key tenets from team effectiveness research to theorize when role-based coordination might be more or less effective. We develop these ideas in a multimethod study of a hospital emergency department (ED) redesign. Before the redesign, people coordinated in ad hoc groupings, which provided flexibility because any nurse could work with any doctor, but these groupings were limited in effectiveness because people were not accountable to each other for progress, did not have shared understanding of their work, and faced interpersonal risks when reaching out to other roles. The redesign introduced new mesolevel structures that bounded a set of roles (rather than a set of specific individuals, as in a team) and gave them collective responsibility for a whole task. We conceptualized the mesolevel structures as team scaffolds and found that they embodied the logic of both role and team structures. The team scaffolds enabled small-group interactions to take the form of an actual team process with team-level prioritizing, updating, and helping, based on newfound accountability, overlapping representations of work, and belonging—despite the lack of stable team composition. Quantitative data revealed changes to the coordination patterns in the ED (captured through a two-mode network) after the team scaffolds were implemented and showed a 40% improvement in patient throughput time.

Common practice in such systems is to first identify staffing levels and then determine schedules for the servers that cover these levels. We propose a new stochastic integer programming (SIP) model that integrates these two decisions, which can yield lower scheduling costs by exploiting the presence of alternative server configurations that yield similar quality of service. We find that a branch-and-cut algorithm based on Benders decomposition may fail due to the weakness of the relaxation bound. We propose a novel application of mixed-integer rounding to improve the Benders cuts used in this algorithm, a technique that is applicable to any SIP with integer first-stage decision variables. Numerical examples illustrate the computational efficiency of the proposed approach and the potential benefit of solving the integrated model compared to considering the staffing and scheduling problems separately.

Since customer service representatives (agents) have different call-handling abilities and are typically cross-trained in multiple skills, contact centers exploit skill-based routing (SBR) to assign calls to appropriate agents, aiming to respond properly as well as promptly. Established agent-staffing and SBR algorithms ensure that agents have the required call-handling skills and that call routing is performed so that constraints are met for standard congestion measures, such as the percentage of calls of each type that abandon before starting service and the percentage of answered calls of each type that are delayed more than a specified number of seconds. We propose going beyond traditional congestion measures to focus on the expected value derived from having particular agents handle various calls. Expected value might represent expected revenue or the likelihood of first-call resolution. Value might also reflect agent call-handling preferences. We show how value-based routing (VBR) and preference-based routing (PBR) can be introduced in the context of an existing SBR framework, based on static-priority routing using a highly-structured priority matrix, so that constraints are still met for standard congestion measures. Since an existing SBR framework is used to implement VBR and PBR, it is not necessary to replace the automatic call distributor (ACD). We show how mathematical programming can be used, with established staffing requirements, to find a desirable priority matrix. We select the priority matrix to use during a specified time interval (e.g., 30-minute period) by maximizing the total expected value over that time interval, subject to staffing constraints.

We explore the opportunities of simulation-optimization approaches in such a context. Two simulation-optimization approaches are evaluated: a fast two-step heuristic and a branch-and-bound method that yields an estimated optimal shift schedule. We compare their computational effort and personnel costs, and analyze the sensitivity of the methods to the number of replications that is used in the simulation model.

The need to jointly price the services assumes significance because they are partial substitutes of one another. Our study finds that the influence of the logistics network on prices is especially strong when there are non-linearities in the cost of provisioning the logistics services. Furthermore, the impact of logistics decisions on different types of pricing schemes (e.g., volume discount, bundled pricing) is different, both in its structure and extent. In present times, when the market for the fit-sorting service is relatively immature, our findings have major implications to the way an SLP's business is managed.

Security is a major concern for firms that move to the cloud. The security of a cloud is the joint responsibility of the cloud provider and cloud users. However, the extent to which the provider and users can affect cloud security through their efforts depends on the cloud service model. In this study, we develop a game-theoretical model to study the impact of the cloud service model on provider and user incentives to exert security effort. Our results show that for a given service model, an increase in the user loss from a security breach induces users to exert more security effort. However, if the provider’s service cost is low, the provider profitably free rides on the enhanced user incentives to exert security effort by diminishing his effort. Analogously, the cloud provider is able to profitably free ride on users’ enhanced incentives to exert security effort when the user population is more homogeneous in terms of either cloud valuation or loss from a security breach, depending on the service cost. Our results also have implications for how a cloud provider could possibly target a particular cloud service model to specific user groups based on their characteristics and likelihood of security loss.

One reason, observed in, prior empirical studies, relates to customer ownership. In this paper, we formalize these empirical observations by developing a game-theoretic model to assess the performance of pooling when servers choose their capacities strategically and exhibit varying scopes of customer ownership, captured by two cost components, respectively, associated with the processing time and the waiting time of a server’s customers. We show that the core benefits of pooling are mostly annihilated in this setting. In fact, for any given scope of customer ownership, the queue configuration has almost no impact on the customers’ average throughput time unless (i) servers’ degree of customer ownership is so low that they choose to operate at high utilization and (ii) they care much more about their customers’ processing times than about their waiting times. Under these conditions, adopting a dedicated queue configuration can yield significantly lower throughput times. This prescription becomes even more pertinent if the switch to a dedicated queue configuration is associated with an expansion in the scope of customer ownership, as may happen in practice.

The relevant control is the routing policy, that is, the decision concerning which agent should handle an arriving call when more than one agent is available. We formulate an optimization problem for a call center with heterogeneous agent pools, in which each pool is distinguished by the speed at which agents in that pool handle calls. The objective is to minimize steady-state expected customer wait time subject to a “fairness” constraint on the workload division. We first solve the optimization problem by formulating it as a Markov decision process (MDP), and solving a related linear program. We note that this approach does not in general lead to an optimal policy that has a simple structure. Fortunately, the optimal policy does appear to have a simple structure as the system size grows large, in the Halfin-Whitt many-server heavy-traffic limit regime. Therefore, we solve the diffusion control problem that arises in this regime and interpret its solution as a policy for the original system. The resulting routing policy is a threshold policy that determines server pool priorities based on the total number of customers in the system. We prove that a continuous modification of our proposed threshold routing policy is asymptotically optimal in the Halfin-Whitt limit regime. We furthermore present simulation results to illustrate that our proposed threshold routing policy outperforms a common routing policy used in call centers (that routes to the agent that has been idle the longest).

For this model, we propose staffing and routing rules that are jointly asymptotically optimal in the heavy-traffic many-server QED, ED, and ED + QED regimes, respectively. For the QED regime, our proposed routing rule is FSF, that assigns customers to the fastest server available first. In the ED and ED + QED regimes, all work-conserving policies perform (asymptotically) equally well. In all these regimes, the form of the asymptotically optimal staffing is consistent with the asymptotically optimal staffing in the same regimes in the single-pool case, respectively. In particular, the total service capacity is (asymptotically) equal to a term that is proportional to the arrival rate plus, possibly, a term that is proportional to the square-root of the arrival rate, with both terms being regime dependent. Our specific proposed approximation for the optimal staffing vector is obtained via a straightforward solution to a deterministic optimization problem subject to a linear feasible region.

Cross selling attempt is initiated at the end of a customer’s service every time the number of customers in the system is below a threshold. Both probability generating functions (PGFs) and matrix geometric methods are employed. The relation between the methods is revealed by explicitly calculating the entries of the matrix geometric rate-matrix R. Those entries are expressed in terms of the roots of a determinant of a matrix related to the set of linear equations involving the PGFs. This is a further step towards understanding of the analytical relationship between the two methods. Numerical results are presented, showing the effect of the cross selling intensity and of the threshold level on the systems performance measures. Finally, for a given set of parameters, the optimal threshold level is determined.

If the rate at which customers balk and renege is an increasing, concave function of the number of customers in the system (head count), then the head-count process and the expected rate of lost sales are decreasing and convex in the capacity (service rate or number of servers). This result applies when customers cannot observe the head count, so that the balking probability is zero and the reneging rate increases linearly with the head count. Then the optimal capacity increases with the customer arrival rate but is not monotonic in the reneging rate per customer. When capacity is expensive or the reneging rate is high, the optimal capacity decreases with any further increase in the reneging rate. Therefore, managers must understand customers' impatience to avoid building too much capacity, but customers have an incentive to conceal their impatience, to avoid a degradation in service quality. If the system manager can prevent customers from reneging during service (by requiring advance payment or training employees to establish rapport with customers), the system's convexity properties are qualitatively different, but its comparative statics remain the same. Most important, the prevention of reneging during service can substantially reduce the total expected cost of lost sales and capacity. It increases the optimal capacity (service rate or number of servers) when capacity is expensive and reduces the optimal capacity when capacity is cheap.

The following questions are addressed: How many customer-service representatives are required (staffing), and when should cross-selling opportunities be exercised (control) in a way that will maximize the expected profit of the center while maintaining a prespecified service level target? We tackle these questions by characterizing control and staffing schemes that are asymptotically optimal in the limit, as the system load grows large. Our main finding is that a threshold priority control, in which cross-selling is exercised only if the number of callers in the system is below a certain threshold, is asymptotically optimal in great generality. The asymptotic optimality of threshold priority reduces the staffing problem to a solution of a simple deterministic problem in one regime and to a simple search procedure in another. We show that our joint staffing and control scheme is nearly optimal for large systems. Furthermore, it performs extremely well, even for relatively small systems.

The queue is assumed to be invisible to waiting customers, as in most customer contact centers, when contact is made by telephone, e-mail, or instant messaging. Customers who must wait are told upon arrival either the delay of the last customer to enter service or an appropriate average delay. Models for the customer response are proposed. For a rough-cut performance analysis, prior to detailed simulation, two approximations are proposed: (1) the equilibrium delay in a deterministic fluid model, and (2) the equilibrium steady-state delay in a stochastic model with fixed delay announcements. These approximations are shown to be effective in overloaded regimes, where delay announcements are important, by making comparisons with simulations. Within the fluid model framework, conditions are established for the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium delay, where the actual delay coincides with the announced delay. Multiple equilibria can occur if a key monotonicity condition is violated.

These costs are exacerbated by inefficiencies in hospital processes, which are often manifested by congestion and long delays in patient care. Thus, a queueing-network view of patient flow in hospitals is natural for studying and improving its performance. The goal of our research is to explore patient flow data through the lens of a queueing scientist. The means is exploratory data analysis (EDA) in a large Israeli hospital, which reveals important features that are not readily explainable by existing models. Questions raised by our EDA include: Can a simple (parsimonious) queueing model usefully capture the complex operational reality of the Emergency Department (ED)? What time scales and operational regimes are relevant for modeling patient length of stay in the Internal Wards (IWs)? How do protocols of patient transfer between the ED and the IWs influence patient delay, workload division and fairness? EDA also underscores the importance of an integrative view of hospital units by, for example, relating ED bottlenecks to IW physician protocols. The significance of such questions and our related findings raise the need for novel queueing models and theory, which we present here as research opportunities. Hospital data, and specifically patient flow data at the level of the individual patient, is increasingly collected but is typically confidential and/or proprietary. We have been fortunate to partner with a hospital that allowed us to open up its data for everyone to access.

It summarizes the methodology introduced in Guajardo and Cohen in (Manuf Serv Oper Manag 30(3):440–454, 2018 [6]) and discusses modeling and implementation implications associated with application of the framework for the management of value-added services that are bundled with manufactured products. The framework utilizes the concept of operating segments (introduced by Frei and Morriss in (Uncommon service: how to win by putting customers at the core of your business, 2012 [5])) and considers issues associated with the definition of market segments appropriate for differentiated services as well as for the design of such services. The paper also discusses operational processes and the tradeoffs associated with producing and delivering differentiated service products to market segments. This discussion includes a review of a set of representative analytical models for service delivery that illustrate OM Service research opportunities.

We modeled the analyzed voice gateway and assessed it under different workload scenarios. We evaluated the actual setup under the real current workload demand, as well as future expected demands in terms of voice long-distance calls using PSTN and VoIP providers. Also, the existing voice gateway capacity was tested facing calls to mobile phones through GSM Sim cards. Finally, we tested a proposal setup to reduce the number of simultaneous E1 channels used per voice call, and found that our approach reduced the E1 usage rate by 14%.

An important factor in both is the inherent economies of scale. Therefore, we advance a unifying model covering both applications and study the associated contracting problem under information asymmetry. At the time of contracting, the outsourcing firm, “the originator,” faces uncertainty regarding the demand volume but has private information about its probability distribution. The true demand is quickly observed once the service commences. The service provider invests in capacity before the start of the operation and offers a menu of contracts to screen different types of the originator. Adopting a mechanism design approach, we prove that a menu of two-part tariffs achieves the full-information solution. Hence, it is optimal among all possible contracts (in both settings) because of economies of scale and contractibility of realized demand.

While conventional methods such as cherry-picking of tickets, round-robin methods exhibit bias in terms of the perceived ability of human agents, an analytically suave data-driven approach eliminates such bias, while delivering substantial performance benefits. The ticket allocation problem deals not only with how many tickets to allocate to each resource but also what job to allocate to which resource. Thus, solving two potential riddles baffling the Operations Managers, i.e., allocation as well as assignment. In turn, our solution optimizes the queue waiting time which can reduce the cost and increase customer satisfaction. The solution to the ticket-queuing problem can particularly help in ticket prioritization. Thus, we have dissected the ticket allocation problem in three parts and have attempted to provide solutions to all the three aspects. We assimilated and fused the three-pronged solution into a single solution that can be readily used not only in IT operations but in any operations environment where ticket allocation needs to be optimized. In this paper, we are solving the real-time ticket allocation problem, through agent-scoring approach. This depends on agent success rate and agent effort hours. This is an instantaneous solution that will work in real time, as soon as a ticket lands on the floor.

The demand of different customers who ask for specific skills hinders the ability to balance the workload among servers, thus, task reallocation may be needed. In this paper, we model a call centre with multi-type customers as a multi-class tandem queue and examine how to reallocate the workload among servers. To evaluate the performance of the system, we propose an approximate analytical method based on the aggregation of Markov chain models. To optimally reallocate the workload, we propose a search algorithm based on the optimal computing budget allocation method. A simulation is employed to validate the analytical method and identify regions in which it can be successfully applied. A case study shows the applicability of the approach and quantifies its benefits in a realistic situation.

Conditional on the number of calls in a period, their arrival times are independent and uniformly distributed over the period. This type of model has the advantage of being simple and reasonably flexible, and can match the correlations between the arrival counts in different periods much better than previously proposed models. For the situation where the number of periods is large, so the number of correlations to estimate can be excessive, we propose simple parametric forms for the correlations, defined as functions of the time lag between the periods. We test our proposed models on three data sets taken from real-life call centers and compare their goodness of fit to the best previously proposed methods that we know. In the three cases, the new models provide a much better match of the correlations and coefficients of variation of the arrival counts in individual periods.

We assume that f does not equally depend on all its arguments. Under certain conditions, we prove that, for the same computational cost, the variance of our estimator is lower than the variance of the standard Monte Carlo estimator by a factor of order d. Our method can be used to obtain a low-variance unbiased estimator for the expectation of a function of the state of a Markov chain at a given time step. We study applications to volatility forecasting and time-varying queues. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm dramatically improves on the standard Monte Carlo method for large values of d and is highly resilient to discontinuities.

The main information measure used for predictability of stochastic processes is the entropy rate, which is asymptotic conditional entropy, thus not suitable for application over a finite horizon. We use the conditional entropy to study the predictability of stochastic processes over the finite horizon. It is well-known that the conditional entropies of stationary processes decrease as the processes evolve, implying that, on average, their pasts become more informative about prediction of their future outcomes. Some important operational processes such as martingale, models for maintenance policies, nonhomogeneous Poisson, and mixed Poisson processes are nonstationary. We show that as a nonstationary process evolves, it may provide more information or less information about the future state of the system. We develop results for comparing the predictability of stochastic processes. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics, 2011

The paper is motivated by the work with the business process outsourcing unit providing technical support services from growth markets like India where realestate is one of the major cost drivers along with human capital. Our paper has two distinctive features. Firstly, we model capacity planning problem for seats and scheduling of agents as one single optimization problem leveraging variable service rates of human agents, information which is ignored by workforce planning teams while modeling. Secondly, we formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem which is not trivial given the non-linear nature of service level constraint. We show that the set of linear inequalities required to represent service level constraint for each period can be generated cheaply. We conduct extensive experimentation to compare solutions of the MILP formulation recognizing variability in service rate with the traditional formulation based on mean valued service rates. We find that, in general, our formulation provides a significant reduction in space requirement and the solution minimizes the over-achievement of service level requirement.

We previously showed that a rate-matching control, whereby the service rate is made proportional to the arrival rate, stabilizes the queue-length process but not the (virtual) waiting-time process. To minimize the maximum expected waiting time (and stabilize the expected waiting time), we now consider a modification of the service-rate control involving two parameters: a time lag and a damping factor. We develop an efficient simulation search algorithm to find the best time lag and damping factor. That simulation algorithm is an extension of our recent rare-event simulation algorithm for the GIt/GI/1 queue to the GIt/GIt/1 queue, allowing the time-varying service rate. To gain insight into these controls, we establish a heavy-traffic limit with periodicity in the fluid scale. This produces a diffusion control problem for the stabilization, which we solve numerically by the simulation search in the scaled family of systems with ρ ↑ 1. The state space collapse in that theorem shows that there is a time-varying Little’s law in heavy traffic, implying that the queue length and waiting time cannot be simultaneously stabilized in this limit. We conduct simulation experiments showing that the new control is effective for stabilizing the expected waiting time for a wide range of model parameters, but we also show that it cannot stabilize the expected waiting time perfectly.

An action research study in a multi-client call centre organization is presented. Our findings allow us to indicate some design principles for the four dimensions (method, organization, people and technology), and we show that simple but rigorous methods, such as the one described in the forecasting framework we develop, can bring substantial improvements. Transparency and understanding of the method by stakeholders are also required, so is a structured process, with clear responsibilities and authorities, as well as enhanced communication and information sharing in order to limit potential conflicts. Finally, information tools should be designed to support the forecasting process through ease of use and formalization of judgemental adjustments, thereby contributing to forecasting accuracy and increasing the credibility of the process outcome.

This regulatory scheme is known to provide cost-reduction incentives and serves as the theoretical underpinning behind the hospital prospective reimbursement system used throughout the developed world. This paper uses a game-theoretic queueing model to investigate how yardstick competition performs in service systems (e.g., hospital emergency departments), where in addition to incentivizing cost reduction the regulator wants to incentivize waiting time reduction. We first show that the form of cost-based yardstick competition used in practice results in inefficiently long waiting times. We then demonstrate how yardstick competition can be appropriately modified to achieve the dual goal of cost and waiting-time reduction. In particular, we show that full efficiency (first-best) can be restored if the regulator makes the providers’ reimbursement contingent on their service rates and is also able to charge a provider-specific “toll” to consumers. More important, if such a toll is not feasible, as may be the case in healthcare, we show that there exists an alternative and particularly simple yardstick-competition scheme, which depends on the average waiting time only, that can significantly improve system efficiency (second-best). This scheme is easier to implement because it does not require the regulator to have detailed knowledge of the queueing discipline. We conclude with a numerical investigation that provides insights on the practical implementation of yardstick competition for hospital emergency departments, and we also present a series of modelling extensions.

In order to determine quality, the IT industry seems to be converging towards a set of commonly used metrics, including but not limited to, equipment availability, the time to resolve incidents, etc. In order to improve the quality of their services, service providers need to adopt a consistent and continuous focus on their internal processes, the skills of their people, the organizational structure and so on. On the other hand, the IT service industry has been traditionally labor intensive. Even though a wide range of management tools is available to support even the most complex management tasks, the overall service management process still relies on the existence of humans to make important decisions, perform complex administration tasks and monitor the performance and effectiveness of the overall process. This paper studies the tradeoff between the cost of a service (as manifested by the staffing level) and the corresponding quality metrics (subject to the service level agreement). In particular, we study the cost of service quality through the use of an optimization model that takes into account the constraints and cost factors typically encountered in a service provider environment.

A typical example is from health care: When triage nurses classify patients into different priority groups, they must promptly determine each patient's criticality levels with only partial information on their conditions. We consider such a service system where customers are from one of two possible types. The service time and waiting cost for a customer depends on the customer's type. Customers' type identities are not directly available to the service provider, however, each customer provides a signal, which is an imperfect indicator of the customer's identity. The service provider uses these signals to determine priority levels for the customers with the objective of minimizing the long-run average waiting cost. In most of the paper, each customer's signal equals the probability that the customer belongs to the type that should have a higher priority and customers incur waiting costs that are linear in time. We first show that increasing the number of priority classes decreases costs, and the policy that gives the highest priority to the customer with the highest signal outperforms any finite class priority policy. We then focus on two-class priority policies and investigate how the optimal policy changes with the system load. We also investigate the properties of “good” signals and find that signals that are larger in convex ordering are more preferable. In a simulation study, we find that when the waiting cost functions are nondecreasing, quadratic, and convex, the policy that assigns the highest priority to the customer with the highest signal performs poorly while the two-class priority policy and an extension of the generalized cμ rule perform well.

Avatar-based virtual world education is highly interactive and provides a rich experiential environment compared with textbook-based theory and traditional written assignments. Allowing students to experience the practical consequences of theoretically driven branding efforts and activities also enables a simulation of a complete branding experience through role playing. Quantitative and qualitative data collected at the end of the course reveal that Second Life offers a suitable means to facilitate students’ understanding of theoretical branding concepts and ability to apply the theoretical principles to real-life scenarios. The integration of a virtual world into academic curricula thus suggests a promising method to narrow the classroom gap between branding theory and practice.

It is therefore natural to ask, can a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) with a rate function that is the simple sum of sinusoids provide an adequate description of reality? If so, how can the sinusoidal NHPP be used to improve the performance of service systems? We empirically validate that the sinusoidal NHPP is consistent with arrival data from two settings of great interest in service operations: patient arrivals to an emergency department and customer calls to a bank call centre. This finding provides rigorous justification for the use of the sinusoidal NHPP assumption in many existing queuing models. We also clarify why a sinusoidal NHPP model is more suitable than the standard NHPP when the underlying arrival pattern is aperiodic (e.g., does not follow a weekly cycle). This is illustrated using data from a car dealership and also via a naturalistic staffing simulation based on the call centre. On the other hand, if the arrival pattern is periodic, we explain why both models should perform comparably. Even then, the sinusoidal NHPP is still necessary for managers to use to verify that the arrival pattern is indeed periodic, a step that is seldom performed in applications. Code for fitting the sinusoidal NHPP to data is provided on GitHub. History: This paper has been accepted for the Service Science/Stochastic Systems Joint Special Issue. Funding: N.

Introduction The customer arrival process is a key component of any service system, given that it describes the temporal demand for service. Consequently, there is much interest in studying arrival processes empirically in order to inform modelling. Remarkably, Brown et al. (2005) and Kim and Whitt (2014a, b) show that real-world arrival processes are empirically consistent with something as simple as a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP). This important finding raises the possible existence of a reasonably accurate “hydrogen atom” model of arrival processes, with the missing piece being the functional form of the arrival rate function. Given that customer arrival patterns typically exhibit seasonal effects, a promising candidate is the sinusoidal NHPP that has rate λ(t)= c 0 + ∑ k=1 p c k cos(2π ν k t+ ϕ k ). p (1) The frequencies ν 1 ,…, ν p can take on any values in a prespecified band [−B,+B] , and ϕ k ∈[0,2π) and ck are respectively the phase and amplitude of the kth sinusoid. Furthermore, p does not have to be prespecified and can instead be estimated from data. The sinusoidal NHPP model (1) builds on the truncated Fourier series model in Eick et al. (1993), which restricts the frequencies to be integer multiples of one another ( ν k =k ν 1 ). This restriction results in a periodic function with period 1/ ν 1 that can approximate any square-integrable function over a finite time interval, including trends (via its Fourier expansion). The more general form (1) allows for arrival patterns that are sinusoidal but not necessarily periodic, for example, a pattern that has both a 7-day cycle and a 365.26-day cycle. The sinusoidal NHPP is attractive because it represents the simplest possible functional form for seasonal patterns, and is one of the most analytically tractable.1 Supposing that the sinusoidal NHPP model is in fact a reasonable description of reality, our first goal is to clarify how managers can use it to improve the performance of service systems. We do this in Section 2 by considering separately the class of sinusoidal arrivals that are periodic and the class that are aperiodic. An illustrative example of aperiodic arrivals is given by the solid line in Figure 1, which shows daily customer call volumes for a car dealership in Turkey during the first half (H1) of 2017. We see strong nonweekly cycles driven by the timings of incentive programs and multiyear model refresh cycles. For these data, we expect the sinusoidal NHPP model to perform better than the standard approach for implementing NHPPs, which is to fit a piecewise constant (PC, or polynomial) arrival rate to the data. As will be explained, this is because the standard approach requires (i) the arrival pattern to be periodic and that (ii) the decision maker knows the length of the period, which is typically assumed to be one week. As Figure 1 shows, the predictions generated from the sinusoidal model (blue dashed line) are indeed much closer to the truth than predictions from the standard approach (red dotted line). Figure 1. Daily Number of Calls to a Car Dealership (Solid Line) Note. The sinusoidal model and the piecewise constant one are fit to data from an earlier period, and their predictions for this period are displayed. To more systematically contrast the performances of the sinusoidal and standard NHPP approaches, in Section 3, we use a naturalistic staffing simulation based on data from a bank call centre in the United States. The data provide enough resolution to identify the intraday variations in call volumes for staffing, and the arrival pattern is also aperiodic: In addition to a dominant weekly cycle, we also detect the existence of {15.2, 31.1, 93.3} day cycles in the arrival pattern. By varying the amplitudes of the nonweekly cycles in the simulation relative to the weekly one, we see that staffing decisions based on (1) progressively outperform the standard approach as the underlying arrival rate deviates from a weekly structure. An example of a periodic arrival pattern comes from patient arrivals to an emergency department (ED) in the United States, which we will empirically show to be weekly periodic. For such arrivals, we expect both the sinusoidal and standard NHPP approaches to be comparable, matching what we see in the simulation study. However, in practice, it is rarely known a priori whether the arrival rate for a particular setting is periodic, let alone what the period is. In applications, the periodicity assumption is rarely checked beforehand. The simulation results demonstrate that it is important to first fit the sinusoidal NHPP to arrivals data in order to verify periodicity before proceeding further. Hence, (1) is still useful in this case. After showing why managers should care about sinusoidal NHPPs, our second goal is to rigorously test the sinusoidal NHPP assumption in real-world settings. In Section 4, we develop an exact parametric bootstrap test for whether a given arrivals data set is generated from a sinusoidal NHPP. We use this test in Section 5 to obtain the first systematic evidence that the sinusoidal NHPP is consistent with data from two settings of great interest in service operations: patient arrivals to an emergency department and customer calls to a bank call centre. This is an important finding for the basic science of service systems, because it provides firm support for many existing queuing models that rely heavily on this previously untested assumption. Our finding provides the first rigorous justification for its use. For researchers interested in applying the sinusoidal NHPP model, we include a description of the estimation procedure we use to fit (1) in Appendix A. The accompanying code can be found at www.github.com/rgurlek/sine-NHPP. 1.1. Related Work A popular way to model NHPPs is to use a piecewise constant arrival rate function, for example, by averaging over arrival counts for Tuesdays, 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., over successive weeks. Although this approach can approximate any weekly periodic arrival rate arbitrarily well with small enough intervals, it is nonetheless discontinuous. For continuous rate functions, piecewise linear functions have been proposed (Massey et al. 1996, Zheng and Glynn 2017), and if some smoothness is also desired, cubic splines can be employed (Alizadeh et al. 2008). However, arrival patterns occurring in the real world typically exhibit strong seasonal patterns, as can be seen in emergency departments (Zeltyn et al. 2011, Saghafian et al. 2012, Armony et al. 2015, Shi et al. 2015, Whitt and Zhang 2019). This naturally points to (1) as a candidate for the arrival process, which also comes with the benefit of being infinitely smooth. Although special forms of (1) are frequently assumed in analytic queuing models,2 until recently, it was challenging to fit (1) to data, which may have hindered its adoption in practice. This is because neither the number of frequencies (p) nor the frequencies themselves are assumed to be known in (1), making this an infinite-dimensional estimation problem. The problem was only recently solved in the statistical learning literature (Shao and Lii 2011, Chen et al. 2019). In this paper, we use a variant of the fitting procedure in Chen et al. (2019), which achieves the best possible frequency resolution. Although this paper studies an NHPP arrival model that has a deterministic rate, we note that there is a stream of literature surveyed in Ibrahim et al. (2016) that treats the arrival process as an NHPP with a stochastic rate, that is, a Cox process. This can happen if λ(t) depends on unobserved or stochastic variables, which will introduce additional uncertainty into the estimate of the rate. See the discussions in Jongbloed and Koole (2001), Steckley et al. (2005, 2009), Akşin et al. (2007), Bassamboo et al. (2010), Koçağa et al. (2015), Ibrahim (2018), Whitt and Zhang (2019), Sun and Liu (2021), and the references therein. These more complex models represent refinements of the NHPP and are suited to supporting decision making over short time scales, where recent information (e.g., today’s realized demand, weather forecast) can be used as variables to forecast demand for the near future. Recently, a subclass of the Cox process called the Hawkes process has gained attention as a model for arrivals over even shorter time scales. In a Hawkes arrival process, an arrival increases the intensity of another arrival through self-excitation (Daw and Pender 2018, 2022, Gao and Zhu 2018, Daw et al. 2021). For example, Daw et al. (2021) studies a contact centre where customers chat over text with service representatives, and the arrival of messages from the customers is likely to “excite” the arrival of responses from the representatives. The time scale under consideration here is on the order of minutes, which makes for a novel high-frequency setting. 2. Implications of the Sinusoidal NHPP for Managing Service Systems Even though the sinusoidal NHPP (1) is parsimonious and intuitively appealing, it may not be immediately obvious how it adds value to the management of service systems. The utilitarian manager may question why they should abandon existing NHPP models in favour of (1). In this section, we articulate how the sinusoidal NHPP model can be used to improve the performance of service systems, and in the next section, we back up our argument with results from a naturalistic simulation. Specifically, we examine whether there are particular types of sinusoidal arrival patterns for which the use of (1) can improve the performance of service systems. The answer is of course relative to the other NHPP models currently in use, the most popular ones being piecewise constant or piecewise linear arrival rates (Massey et al. 1996, Zheng and Glynn 2017). Although these models are nonparametric and do not require the arrival rate λ(t) to be periodic, the value of λ(t) is unknown in practice and can only be estimated over some past time interval 0≤t≤T . To extrapolate λ(t) into the future (t > T) for prescriptive use, inevitably one has to assume that λ(t) repeats itself periodically, that is, λ(t)=λ((t−T)mod T) for t > T. A period of one day or one week is commonly assumed in applications, but this is rarely verified empirically beforehand. Hence, to use the existing arrival rate models for decision making, it is necessary to first assume that λ(t) is periodic, and that its period is known to the decision maker. This insight suggests that we segment sinusoidal arrival patterns into two classes: periodic patterns and aperiodic ones. 2.1. Periodic Patterns If the underlying arrival rate is periodic, then the sinusoidal NHPP offers no clear advantage over existing NHPPs, besides being infinitely smooth. This is because the latter can also approximate λ(t) arbitrarily well over the duration of one period, if the length of the period is known. However, in reality, it is rarely known a priori whether the arrival rate for a particular setting is periodic, let alone what the period is. Hence, before applying existing NHPP models, managers should still first fit a sinusoidal NHPP to check whether the periodicity assumption is reasonable. If so, the period can then be inferred from the estimated frequencies. As an example, this is done in Section 5.1, where we verify that a weekly period is appropriate for the patient arrivals to an emergency department, in agreement with Whitt (2018). 2.2. Aperiodic Patterns Suppose the frequencies identified by the fitted sinusoidal NHPP are not compatible with a weekly periodic structure. Using existing NHPPs would then lead to substantial biases if the amplitudes of the nonweekly cycles were sufficiently large, in which case the sinusoidal NHPP would outperform. We saw an example of this in Section 1 regarding customer calls to a Turkish car dealership. A description of the data set and the analysis can be found in Appendix B. Customer calls to the bank call centre that we study in Section 5.2 are another example of aperiodic arrivals: For one of the major customer classes, called Voice Response Unit (VRU)-Premier, we identify three cycles (15.2, 31.1, and 93.3 days) from the data that do not fit with the rest of the week-based cycles. To recap, the sinusoidal NHPP model is necessary and valuable in either scenario. For the first case, it serves as a spectral technique for verifying and estimating the periodicity of the arrival pattern. As such, it complements rather than competes with existing NHPP models. For the second case, it directly serves as the arrival model to use for prescriptive planning. Via the use of naturalistic simulations, in the next section, we illustrate the possible performance gains from using the sinusoidal NHPP to staff service systems driven by aperiodic customer arrivals. 3. Performance of Staffing Policies Based on Sinusoidal NHPP Models We construct a sequence of naturalistic staffing simulations for the bank call centre we will empirically study in Section 5.2. We focus on the VRU-Premier customer class, whose call pattern exhibits nonweekly cycles. (Table 3 lists all the frequencies identified from the data.) The simulations allow us to see how the performance of the sinusoidal NHPP varies as the underlying arrival pattern deviates from a weekly periodic structure. This is achieved by gradually increasing the amplitudes of the nonweekly cycles relative to the week-based ones.3 3.1. Arrival Model The arrival rate functions used to generate the simulations are piecewise constant and inherit the cycles estimated for the VRU-Premier class: a week-based cycle, a 15.2-day cycle, a 31.1-day cycle, and a 93.3-day cycle. We specify a family of arrival rates indexed by α∈{0,1,2,3} as λ(t,α)= c α + WEEKLY i(t) +α{CYC 1 j(t) +CYC 2 k(t) +CYC 3 ℓ(t) }, λ ( ) { } (2) for which we have the following: The week-based fixed effects { WEEKLY i } 336 i=1 for each of the 7×24×2=336 30-minute subintervals of a week. The width of the subintervals are approximately how often staffing levels are adjusted in call centres (Dietz 2011). The fixed effects {CYC 1 j } 10 j=1 for the 15.2-day cycle, broken into 10 piecewise constant subintervals of equal width, and {CYC 2 k } 10 k=1 and {CYC 3 ℓ } 10 ℓ=1 follow the same approach for the 31.1-day cycle and the 93.3-day cycle, respectively. Having more subintervals allows us to better reproduce the exact cycle, but the piecewise constant ground truth will also converge toward a smooth cyclic one. This would give the sinusoidal NHPP an increasing advantage. The constant c α is set as the smallest one that ensures λ(t,α)≥0 . Given that it is constant, it plays no role in determining the seasonality of the arrivals. For our purpose of investigating how the cycles in the arrival pattern affect the relative performance of staffing policies based on the sinusoidal NHPP, the trend is of ancillary interest and is excluded from (2).4 The values of the seasonal fixed effects { WEEKLY i } i , {CYC 1 j } j , {CYC 2 k } k , and {CYC 3 ℓ } ℓ are estimated in the following way. First, the arrivals in the VRU-Premier data are aggregated into 30-minute subintervals, where yt is the count for the subinterval that begins at time t=m/2 hours for m≥0 . These are then regressed onto dummies for the seasonal effects and also an intercept and a linear trend. Only the seasonal effects are used in (2). When α = 0, the arrival rate (2) is purely weekly periodic. A weekly periodic piecewise constant model that is fit to arrivals data generated from λ(t,0) should then perform the best. However, as α grows, the nonweekly cycles will come to dominate, so the sinusoidal NHPP should perform better. 3.2. Simulation Model We first model the call centre as an M t /M/ s t queue where customer calls arrive according to λ(t,α) . The staffing level at time t is st, which can be adjusted every 30 minutes. From the data, we estimate the exponential service rate to be 18.6 customers per hour per agent. As a second model, we allow for a completely general service time distribution, that is, M t /G/ s t , as a contrast to the simple exponential one in the first model. The distribution for the general service time is estimated from the empirical distribution of the call durations. Although it is possible to also add customer abandonment to the model, as is done in the analysis of the dealership data (Appendix B), the results there suggest that our qualitative findings would not change as α increases. For each model and for each α∈{0,1,2,3} , we generate call arrivals and service times over 12 months to use as the in-sample period, and also generate a 13th month as the test period. This is in line with the empirical analysis of the bank call centre data in Section 5.2, where the sinusoidal NHPP is fit to data from April 2001 to March 2002, and April 2002 is held out as the test period. The simulated in-sample period is used to fit three competing NHPP models to use for planning staffing levels for the test period: Weekly PC: The arrival rate is piecewise constant over each of the 168 hours of the week. The weekly period is a typical assumption in applications where spectral methods are not used beforehand to inspect the frequencies in the arrival pattern. Note that the ground truth (2) is also piecewise constant. Monthly PC: The arrival rate pattern is piecewise constant and repeats every 30 days. The model employs the same number of intervals as Weekly PC, but is based on a 30-day period rather than a 7-day one. Sine: This is the sinusoidal NHPP (1). 3.3. Staffing Policies Staffing decisions for the test period depend not only on the arrival and service rates fitted to the in-sample period, but also on the manager’s objective. We consider two commonly used objectives: Delay: The probability that an arriving customer has to wait before receiving service is P( N t ≥ s t ), ( ) where Nt is the number of customers currently in the system. The manager’s problem is to find the smallest st subject to the constraint that the delay probability is below a prespecified threshold. A 20% threshold is used in this study. Cost: The expected cost of staffing plus customer waiting cost is c salary ⋅ s t + c wait ⋅E max( N t − s t ,0). ( ) The manager’s problem is to choose st to minimize this. The waiting cost c wait = $70.5/hour is based on the one for high-priority customers of an Israeli bank call centre in 2008 (Akşin et al. 2013), but adjusted to 2021 U.S. salary levels. The agent staffing cost c salary = $15.7/hour is taken from the average 2004 U.S. call centre salary figure in Hillmer et al. (2004), adjusted to 2021 dollars. Our goal is not to develop optimal staffing policies under each objective. Rather, we aim to compare the performances of the arrival models under a widely used staffing rule called the modified-offered-load (MOL) approximation as described in Feldman et al. (2008). We use the MOL approximation to set st for each 30-minute interval in the test period. In the context of an M t /G/ s t queue, the MOL approach first calculates the mean number of busy servers, m ∞ t , for the infinite server version of the queue, that is, M t /G/∞ . The term m ∞ t has a closed-form expression, and we use its maximum value inside an interval as the offered load for the finite-server queue. The stationary distribution of this queue is then used to solve for the manager’s problem to obtain st. 3.4. Results Tables 1 and 2 display the performance of using the PC and Sine models fits to staff the call center during the test period, for the M t /M/ s t and M t /G/ s t models, respectively. Before delving into the results, note that the PC models share the same piecewise constant structure as the ground truth (2) used to generate the data. This gives the Weekly PC model an unfair advantage especially when α = 0, because in this case, its weekly period is also correctly specified for the underlying arrival rate. Table 1. Performances Under the M t /M/ s t Ground Truth  Table 2. Performances Under the M t /G/ s t Ground Truth  For the staffing policies driven by the delay objective, we first calculate the percentages of customers who had to wait during the test period, Pwait, and then report the amounts in excess of 20% in the left columns of the tables: max( P wait −20%,0). ( ) If this is zero, then the staffing policy achieves the intended goal of capping the proportion of customers who have to wait to 20%. Focusing on the results for the M t /M/ s t ground truth first (Table 1), we see that the staffing policy based on the Sine model achieves the delay target for all values of α, whereas the staffing policy based on the Weekly PC model fails as the nonweekly cycles grow with α. For example, when α = 3, the proportion of customers who have to wait is 20+10=30% under the M t /M/ s t ground truth, which is 50% higher than the cap. Even worse, the Monthly PC model misses the delay target by 15 percentage points even when α = 0. For the staffing policies driven by the cost objective, we report the average daily costs realized during the test period in the right columns of the tables. Once again focusing first on Table 1, we see that Sine staffing always performs better than Weekly PC staffing, except for the weekly periodic case (α = 0). We observe cost savings of up to 19% as the nonweekly cycles grow with α. As mentioned earlier, the Weekly PC model enjoys an unfair advantage over the Sine model when α = 0. Despite this, Sine staffing is less than 0.5% more costly in this case. Monthly PC staffing performs the worst of the three, with costs that are two to three times higher than those incurred under Sine staffing. The poor performance of the Monthly PC model even at α = 0 (when only a weekly cycle exists) is due to the fact that it is unable to adapt to the seven-day cycle, because 30 is not a multiple of seven. The performance is further exacerbated by the other nonmonthly cycles as α grows. With this understanding, it suffices to focus on the Weekly PC benchmark for the simulation based on the M t /G/ s t ground truth (Table 2). We see that the situation is essentially the same as in the case for M t /M/ s t . Thus, whether we assume exponential or general service times, Sine staffing always performs better than Weekly PC staffing, except for the weekly periodic case (α = 0). Putting the results together, we see as expected that the sinusoidal NHPP outperforms when the arrival pattern deviates from a periodic structure. This finding is robust to the service time distribution employed, from the simple exponential to completely general ones. Applications that employ existing NHPP models implicitly assume that the arrival pattern is periodic, but this assumption is rarely tested beforehand. Our results demonstrate that failing to do so can lead to significant performance losses. 4. Testing for Sinusoidal NHPPs Having provided arguments for why managers should care about the sinusoidal NHPP (1), before employing them, we still have to first verify that it is in fact a reasonable model for real-world arrivals. Given customer arrival timestamps { t j } N(T) j=1 generated from an arrival process N(⋅) in the observation window (0,T] , we develop a statistical test for whether N(⋅) is a sinusoidal NHPP. Specifically, the null hypothesis of interest is H sNHPP 0 :N(⋅)∈ N sNHPP ={NHPPs with rate function (1)}. sNHPP sNHPP Note that this is more stringent than the null hypothesis tested in Brown et al. (2005) and Kim and Whitt (2014a), H NHPP 0 :N(⋅)∈ N NHPP ={NHPPs with any rate function}, NHPP NHPP because N sNHPP ⊂ N NHPP . For example, tests based on H NHPP 0 cannot distinguish an NHPP with a linear rate from an NHPP with a sinusoidal one, because both belong in N NHPP . In other words these tests have no statistical power to reject nonsinusoidal NHPPs. This is by design, because Brown et al. (2005) and Kim and Whitt (2014a) are interested only in whether the arrival process is an NHPP, so they treat the arrival rate function as a nuisance parameter. On the other hand, tests based on the sharper null H sNHPP 0 , such as the one we develop here, go one step further to pin down the functional form of the arrival rate function. To do this, we first need an estimate of the sinusoidal rate function. Given that a fitting procedure did not exist until recently, this may explain the lack of work on validating the sinusoidal NHPP to date. 4.1. Fitting Sinusoidal NHPPs Fitting the sinusoidal NHPP (1) is more complicated than fitting the special case of the truncated Fourier series model in Eick et al. (1993). In the latter, the frequencies ν 1 ,…, ν p are prespecified, so the amplitudes c 0 ,…, c p and phases ϕ 1 ,…, ϕ p can be estimated using (complex-valued) linear regression. The more flexible case (1) allows the frequencies to be free, so they also need to be estimated from data as well. Appendix C provides a stunning counterexample showing how standard spectral methods can fail at this. Fortunately, the statistical learning technique introduced in Chen et al. (2019) is able to provably recover (1) if the underlying arrival process is indeed a sinusoidal NHPP. However, the approach uses a thresholding step that is not trivial to apply. In Appendix A, we introduce a simpler variant that works well in practice (Algorithm A.1), with code provided on GitHub (www.github.com/rgurlek/sine-NHPP). This is the method that will be used in this paper, and is also the approach we recommend to managers of service systems. 4.2. The Statistical Test Given a consistent estimate λ ^ (t) of the sinusoidal arrival rate, we divide the arrivals window (0,T] into subintervals and test the null H sNHPP 0 within each subinterval. Because no model is perfect, we do not expect the parsimonious sinusoidal NHPP model to fit well to all subintervals. Therefore, if it passes a goodness-of-fit test for a large majority of subintervals, then we deem it to be a reasonable model. We first propose a test for a single time interval, and then describe multiple testing corrections for applying the test to all subintervals. 4.2.1. Single Subinterval. Consider testing for the arrival process N(⋅) generating the arrivals t 1 ,…, t N in an interval [ t 0 , t 0 +L) .5 We use the time-change property of NHPPs as articulated in Proposition 1 below to develop an exact parametric bootstrap test that applies to an NHPP with a given hypothesized arrival rate function. This differs from the test in Brown et al. (2005) and Kim and Whitt (2014a), which is based on the conditional uniform property of homogeneous Poisson processes. Their test does not specify a particular functional form for the arrival rate of the NHPP, so they use a Poisson process with a constant rate to locally approximate the unknown arrival rate over small time subintervals. This results in a nonexact test that requires the subinterval widths to shrink at an appropriate rate for it to be asymptotically valid. Proposition 1. The arrivals t 1 ,…, t N  follow an NHPP with rate (1) and cumulative rate  Λ(t)= ∫ t 0 λ(u)du  if and only if { u j =exp[Λ( t j−1 )−Λ( t j )]} j { [ ( ) ( ) ] } (3) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) U(0, 1). It follows that if the distribution of { u j } j deviates significantly from uniformity, we should reject the null that t 1 ,…, t N come from an NHPP with rate λ(t) . One possible test for this is to use the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic sup t∈(0,1) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 1 N ∑ k=1 N I( u j ≤t)−t ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ , | | (4) whose exact null distribution can be obtained using parametric bootstrap. Observe from Proposition 1 that this test is consistent in power, that is, there is no other arrival process besides an NHPP with rate λ(t) for which { u j } j are i.i.d. U(0, 1). In the case where there is no arrival in [ t 0 , t 0 +L) , the probability that a Poisson distribution with mean Λ( t 0 +L)−Λ( t 0 ) is equal to zero, exp[−{Λ( t 0 +L)−Λ( t 0 )}], { } (5) serves as the p-value for the null hypothesis. In practice, substituting the estimated Λ ^ (t) for Λ(t) means that the null hypothesis we are actually testing is that the arrival process is an NHPP with the particular sinusoidal rate λ ^ (t) . Note that this even more stringent than H sNHPP 0 , which is to test whether the NHPP rate function follows any sinusoidal pattern at all. 4.2.2. All Subintervals. If each subinterval is of length L, then applying the test above to each subinterval will yield T/L hypothesis tests. A multiple testing correction is then needed to control the number of false rejections at the 5% level. For a single test (i.e., T/L=1 ), this corresponds to controlling the type I error, and a generalization of the type I error to multiple tests is the familywise error rate FWE=P(#false positives>0). ( false ) (6) To see why it is not enough to just control the type I error of each individual test (i.e., reject a test whenever its p-value is less than 0.05), suppose for simplicity that we have 10 independent tests, and that all null hypotheses are true. Thus, the probability that each test results in a false rejection is 0.05, but the probability that there is at least one false rejection among the tests is FWE=1− 0.95 10 >0.4 . We will use the procedure of Holm (1979) to ensure that FWE≤0.05 . The procedure is uniformly more powerful than the better-known Bonferroni correction, and works in the following way: Let P (1) ,…, P (T/L) be the ordered p-values from the smallest to the largest, and compute the smallest k such that P (k) > 0.05 T/L+1−k . 0.05 (7) The null hypotheses associated with P (1) ,…, P (k−1) are then rejected, whereas the ones associated with the larger p-values are not. Note that the FWE is the probability that any of the rejected nulls is a false rejection, so it can be very hard to control when there are a large number of tests. A popular alternative is to control the false discovery rate FDR=E( #false rejections #rejections ) ( ) (8) instead, which is the expected proportion of false rejections among all the rejected nulls. This criterion is less stringent and provides more statistical power because FDR≤FWE , hence, any test that controls FWE automatically controls FDR as well. As a separate check, we will use the procedure in theorem 1.3 of Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001) to control the FDR at the 5% level. This procedure seeks the largest k such that P (k) ≤ 0.05k (T/L) ∑ T/L j=1 (1/j) , 0.05 k (9) and rejects the null hypotheses associated with P (1) ,…, P (k) . 5. Validating the Sinusoidal NHPP in Real-World Settings Armed with the statistical test developed in Section 4 for assessing the sinusoidal NHPP assumption, we now analyze arrivals data from two settings of great interest to the service operations community: patient arrivals to an emergency department and customer calls to a bank call centre. Our results provide empirical support for the sinusoidal NHPP assumption, but in general, each new setting should be validated before use. The analysis we follow here can serve as a template for testing those settings as well. 5.1. ED Patient Arrivals We analyze a data set from the ED of a U.S. academic hospital containing timestamps for 168,392 patient arrivals from 2014 to third quarter (Q3) of 2015 (T = 652 days). In addition, the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) of each patient is also recorded, with level 1 being the most severe (e.g., cardiac arrest) and level 5 the least (e.g., rash). Information on demand for ED services is a critical input to staffing and other operational decisions that influence the efficiency of healthcare delivery, and it enables the construction of high-resolution queuing simulations. For the ED in question, ESI level 1 trauma patients ( <1% of arrivals) are assigned to dedicated bedspaces on arrival and are therefore excluded from the analysis. ESI level 2 patients are treated in a ward separate from the other ESI levels, so from a capacity management perspective, we will analyze this group on its own. Previously, Chen et al. (2019) fitted a sinusoidal rate for this group using their technique, and visually compared the fit to the empirical average rate for each hour of the week. Such a cursory analysis is, however, far from complete, because the arrival rate itself tells us nothing about the statistical process of the arrivals: The fitted rate can be consistent with a Cox process with a mean rate that is sinusoidal, and it can even be consistent with a deterministic arrival process. Here, we systematically analyze the data to determine whether the arrival data come from a sinusoidal NHPP. ESI level 3 to level 5 arrivals are not only distinct from level 2 from a capacity management standpoint, they are also behaviourally different in a way that can potentially violate the NHPP property. Whereas level 2 patients require immediate care from the time illness occurs, lower-acuity patients belonging to levels 3 to 5 often have flexibility to delay seeking treatment. Thus, even if the occurrence of illness among these patients follows an NHPP, the flexibility to postpone treatment may result in non-NHPP arrivals to the ED. Indeed, our analysis suggests that low-acuity cases may delay seeking treatment going into the weekend, resulting in a spike in visit volume on Monday. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze this group independently of ESI level 2. 5.1.1. ESI Level 2. A total of 66,240 patient arrivals were assigned an ESI level of 2. As shown in the left panel of Figure 2, our fitting procedure (Algorithm A.1 in Appendix A) selected four intraday frequencies and six week-based ones. The intraday frequencies include a daily cycle ( ν ^ 1 =1.00 ), a 12-hour cycle ( ν ^ 2 =2.00 ), an 8-hour cycle ( ν ^ 3 =3.00 ), and a 6-hour one ( ν ^ 4 =4.00 ). The week-based cycles include a 1-week cycle ( ν ^ 4 =0.142 ), a 1/2-week cycle ( ν ^ 5 =0.286 ), a 1/3-week cycle ( ν ^ 6 =0.429 ), a 1/5-week cycle ( ν ^ 7 =0.714 ), a 1/6-week cycle ( ν ^ 8 =0.857 ), and a 1/8-week cycle ( ν ^ 6 =1.143 ). Figure 2. ESI Level 2 Arrivals Notes. The left panel shows the centralized windowed periodogram ((A.3) in Appendix A). The selected threshold is represented by the dashed horizontal line, and the location of the frequency estimates ν ^ k are given by the vertical ones. In the right panel, the estimated arrival rate (arrivals per day) over the course of a week is given by the solid line. The dashed and dotted line represents the empirical average arrival rate for each hour of the week. Given that the fitted rate has a weekly period, we can compare it to the empirical average arrival rate for each hour of the week (right panel of Figure 2). The estimate reveals two intraday peaks, the first at around 11:00 a.m. and the second at around 5:00 p.m. We also see that the intensity of arrivals fades steadily into the weekend. For most parts of the week, the sinusoidal fit does a very good job capturing the variation in the empirical arrival rate, at least from a visual standpoint. To use the statistical tests from Section 4 to rigorously quantify the goodness of fit of a sinusoidal NHPP, we divide the arrival data into time subintervals of length L = 2 hours. Of the resulting T/L=7,824 subintervals, the null hypotheses for only 7% of them are rejected, and this is before applying any multiple testing corrections (which will reject even fewer hypotheses). Hence, the sinusoidal NHPP is a reasonable model for ESI level 2 arrivals. 5.1.2. ESI Levels 3 to 5. There were in aggregate 99,205 arrivals assigned to ESI levels 3 to 5. Figure 3 shows that three of the intraday frequencies from the level 2 case are selected (the six-hour cycle is now absent), and only the 1/5- and 1/6-week cycles are selected from the week-based ones. The estimated arrival rate exhibits a more subdued day-of-week effect when compared with level 2, but the midday peak is now more pronounced relative to the evening one. We know from Fourier theory that capturing these time-localized effects will require more sine waves than the sparse specification (1) is designed for, which explains the sinusoidal model’s underfit to the large peaks early on in the week. Interestingly, the peaks drop from Thursday on as the weekend approaches, and culminates in a substantial spike in arrivals on Monday. As alluded to earlier, this could be related to the fact that low-acuity patients have flexibility in deciding when to seek treatment. Future research should look into the behavioural mechanisms behind this pattern. Figure 3. ESI Levels 3 to 5 Notes. The left panel shows the centralized windowed periodogram, selected threshold, and locations of the frequency estimates ν ^ k . The right panel shows the estimated (solid line) and empirical (dashed and dotted line) arrival rates over the course of a week. Despite this potential complication, only 8% of the 7,824 subintervals are rejected, just slightly more than for level 2 arrivals. Thus, the sinusoidal NHPP remains a good model for ESI level 3–5 arrivals. 5.1.3. Seasonal Effects. No year-based seasonal cycles (365/12 (monthly), 365/4 (quarterly), 365/2, 365) are selected from the data. As explained in Appendix A, our fitting procedure cannot resolve frequencies that are within 4/T=4/652 cycles/day of each other, so it is possible that we missed cycles larger than 652/4=163 days, that is, the semiannual and annual cycles. To see whether these cycles actually exist in the data, we add them to the set of frequencies selected by our procedure and reestimate the amplitudes of the cycles. For both ESI groups, we find that the semiannual cycle is negligible, and that the annual cycle is weaker than the weakest frequency signal selected by our procedure. For example, for ESI levels 3 to 5, the amplitudes of the selected frequencies range from 4.0 to 44. The amplitudes of the semiannual and annual cycles are 0.82 and 3.3, respectively. Thus, our finding is consistent with Whitt (2018), which argues that a week is the natural period to use in healthcare settings. 5.2. Customer Calls to a Bank Call Centre The call data come from a bank in the United States, and were kindly made available by the SEELab at Technion (Mandelbaum 2017). The bank’s call centre consists of sites across the Northeast that are integrated into one virtual centre. About a fifth of the callers seek to speak with a live agent, whereas the rest conduct self-service transactions at the VRU, Announcement, or Message stages. Kim and Whitt (2014a, section 5.4) studies whether the call arrivals between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. in the 30 days of April 2001 can be modelled by NHPPs. Among the eight call types in the data, six are found to pass the NHPP test in more than 75% of days. These call types are VRU-Premier, VRU-Business, VRU-Loan, VRU-Summit, Business, and Message. To further test whether arrivals from these call types can be modelled by a sinusoidal NHPP, we use calls arriving between April 2001 and March 2002 inclusive to fit the arrival rate, and hold out April 2002 as the test period. Arrivals of the type VRU-Summit appeared in only 140 days of record during the period (up until August 2001), therefore, we consider only the other five types of calls. Table 3 shows the 21 frequencies selected by our fitting procedure for the arrival rate of VRU-Premier calls. In addition to the intraday and the week-based cycles, frequencies with periods of 15.2 days, 31.1 days, and 93.3 days are also selected. Because these do not divide seven evenly, the arrival rate for a specific hour of a particular day of week will vary from week to week, making it impossible to plot the empirical arrival rates over the course of a week like those in Figures 2 and 3. The deviation from a weekly structure may also explain a portion of the overdispersion discovered in Kim and Whitt (2014a). Table 3. Frequencies Selected for the Arrival Rate of VRU-Premier Calls The first column of Table 4 displays the number of calls of each type from April 2001 to March 2002 inclusive. We see that VRU-Loan has the lightest call volume, but on a per unit time basis, even this has roughly four times as many arrivals as ESI levels 3–5 in Section 5.1. This allows us to use 30-minute subintervals for the statistical tests in Section 4, which is approximately how often staffing levels are adjusted in call centres (Dietz 2011). The last two columns of Table 4 show the results of applying the tests to the April 2001 period studied in Kim and Whitt (2014a). Whether we correct for multiple testing issues using FWE or FDR, we see that the null hypotheses for most of the subintervals are not rejected. Applying the tests to call arrivals in the April 2002 test period yields similar results (Table 5). Taken together, our results build on the finding in Kim and Whitt (2014a) by further showing that the sinusoidal NHPP is a reasonable model for NHPP call types. Table 4.

Discussion Special forms of the sinusoidal NHPP (1) have long been employed in the queuing literature. This is the first paper to systematically validate the model as a reasonable one for arrival processes of interest in service operations, providing firm support for the many existing queuing models that rely heavily on this previously untested assumption. From a prescriptive viewpoint, our work clarifies how the sinusoidal NHPP can be used to improve the performance of service systems. Our simulation results highlight the importance of first verifying the periodicities in the arrivals data before imposing a periodic structure on the fitted arrival rate function. Given the simplicity and tractability of the sinusoidal NHPP, we hope our findings will spur more interest in its practical adoption. In turn, we hope this will encourage queuing theorists to revisit the sinusoidal NHPP as a workhorse model for time-varying arrivals. Such efforts could generate further analytical results that add to the existing ones for sinusoidal arrival rates (Eick et al. 1993, Feldman et al. 2008, Liu and Whitt 2012), potentially leading to a virtuous cycle where theory advances practice and vice versa.

Estimation Procedure for Fitting (1) Here we introduce a simpler variant of the estimation procedure in Chen et al. (2019) that works well in practice. Code for implementing this can be found at www.github.com/rgurlek/sine-NHPP. Before diving into the details of the estimation, there are two considerations that researchers interested in deploying sinusoidal NHPPs should be aware of. First, the frequencies ν 1 ,…, ν p in (1) cannot be too close to each other, for otherwise it would be impossible to distinguish between them in a noisy setting. It suffices for the frequencies to be spaced apart from one another by more than O(1/T) . To make things concrete, we assume this gap is O(logT/T) . In finite samples, our procedure also requires the gap between frequencies to be sufficiently positive, that is, no smaller than 4/T : min k≠k' | ν k − ν k' |=max(4,logT)/T. | | ( log ) / (A.1) Second, the precision of the frequency estimates { ν ^ k } k need to be sharper than O(1/T) in order to obtain consistent estimates for λ(t) itself, that is, max k | ν k − ν ^ k |= o p (1/T). (A.2) Unlike (A.1), this is a property required of the estimation procedure, rather than an assumption imposed on the arrival rate. Note that (A.2) is stronger than consistency of the frequency estimates, which requires only a precision of o p (1) . In Appendix C, we present a spectacular real-life example to show how standard spectral techniques can fail to achieve (A.2), and hence lead to disastrously wrong estimates for λ(t) . To provide intuition for our estimation approach under the frequency resolution (A.1), the frequency components of the arrival process N(t)= ∑ j I( t j ≤t) consists of ν 1 ,…, ν p mixed in with the frequency components of statistical noise. This is because we can decompose the arrival process into its Doob–Meyer form, dN(t)=λ(t)dt+dε(t), d ( ) λ ( ) d d ( ) where ε(t) is Poisson noise. We can separate out ν 1 ,…, ν p from the noise frequencies by thresholding: With high probability, all of the frequency components of ε(t) have amplitudes less than some threshold τ that is decreasing in T. This threshold represents the level of noise in the frequency domain. Thus, graphing the power spectrum of N(t) and then eliminating frequencies whose amplitudes are less than τ will leave behind a band of frequencies around each νk. Picking the frequency corresponding to the largest amplitude within each band provides us with estimates for the νk’s. Figure A.1 illustrates the idea for p = 2. Figure A.1. Illustration of the Estimation Procedure in Algorithm A.1 (Reproduced from Chen et al. (2019)) Notes. In the depicted periodogram, there are two signal frequencies, ν1 and ν2. Setting τ (horizontal line) above the ambient noise level leaves behind two bands (between the pairs of vertical lines) that contain ν1 and ν2. Although there exists a theoretically justified bound for τ, in practice, the noise level can often be eyeballed from the power spectrum plot, see, for example, Figures 2 and 3. Hence, we will select τ by visual inspection instead. We verified that this yields essentially the same arrival rate fits in our empirical analyses, showing that this simpler approach is effective in practice. This is to be expected, because only frequencies with small amplitudes (on par with the noise level) might be missed this way, whereas the overall arrival rate fit is driven by the dominant frequencies. The estimation procedure is described in Algorithm A.1. We make two remarks. First, the frequency components of N(t) can be visualized using a periodogram, which plots the frequency amplitudes against the frequencies (see Figure A.1). Algorithm A.1 uses the centralized and windowed periodogram | H c (ν)|= 1 T ∣ ∣ ∣ ∫ T 0 w(t) e −2πiνt (dN(t)− N(T) T dt) ∣ ∣ ∣ = 1 T ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∑ j sin 2 ( π t j T ) e −2πiν t j −N(T) sin(πTν) e −iπTν 2πTν{1− (Tν) 2 } ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ , (A.3) where the choice of window w(t)= sin 2 (πt/T) is optimized for the frequency gap (A.1). Second, when plotting | H c (ν)| on a frequency grid, the grid needs to be at least as fine as o(1/T) , otherwise, the resulting frequency estimates may not satisfy (A.2). Chen et al. (2019) shows that their technique will consistently recover the sinusoidal NHPP (1) if, informally, the ratio of the largest to the smallest amplitude max k | c k |/ min k | c k | is less than 14.5. This can, however, be greatly relaxed. For example, if the constant four appearing in the frequency gap (A.1) is relaxed to six, then the maximum allowable ratio can be increased to over 100, provided that we replace the window in (A.3) with w(t)= sin 4 (πt/T) and substitute r=3/T in Step 2 of Algorithm A.1. Given that Algorithm A.1 is the same as in Chen et al. (2019) save for the choice of τ, we also expect consistent recovery under the same conditions. If theoretical guarantees for the estimation procedure are absolutely required for a particular application, then the threshold used in Chen et al. (2019) can always be used. Algorithm A.1 (Procedure for Fitting (1)) 1 Graph the periodogram | H c (ν)| defined in (A.3) over the range [−B,+B] of frequencies of interest. 2 Set r=2/T and visually estimate the noise level τ from the periodogram. 3 Identify the frequency region R={ν:r≤|ν|≤B,| H c (ν)|>τ} where the value of periodogram exceeds τ. 4 Set ν 0 =0 , k = 1 and repeat the following steps: • Find the highest stationary peak of the periodogram in R and set ν ^ k as the corresponding frequency location. If no peaks exist, then exit loop. • Perform the updates k←k+1 and R←R\( ν ^ k −r, ν ^ k +r) . This removes a neighbourhood of radius r centred at ν ^ k from R. 5 c ^ 0 ,…, c ^ p and ϕ ^ 1 ,…, ϕ ^ p are given by the moduli and phases of the entries of the complex-valued vector Γ ^ −1 y , where the (j, k)-entry of the (p+1)×(p+1) matrix Γ ^ is Γ ^ jk = e −iπT( ν ^ j − ν ^ k ) sin{πT( ν ^ j − ν ^ k )} πT( ν ^ j − ν ^ k ) , and the kth entry of the (p+1) -vector y is 1/T ∑ j e −2πi ν ^ k t j . Appendix B. Customer Calls to a Car Dealership These data consist of daily customer call volumes for a car dealership in Turkey from January 2015 to June 2017, inclusive, with the first two years set aside as the in-sample period, and H1 2017 reserved for the test period. Each arrival is a phone call by a potential customer, and they are served by one of the sales staff between the business hours of 8:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., six days a week (closed Sundays). As a result, we will operate under a six-day week. The mean and median numbers of calls received per day are 19.1 and 18, respectively, with a high of 92. The arrival pattern over the entire period is given in Figure B.1. We see strong seasonal patterns that extend well beyond the weekly time frame, driven possibly by the timings of incentive programs and multiyear model refresh cycles. Figure B.1. Daily Call Volumes to the Turkish Dealership from January 2015 to June 2017 Fitting Sine and PC Arrival Models We fit the Sine and PC models from Section 3 to the in-sample period of the dealership data. The fitted models are then used to plan staffing for the test period. In contrast to the ED and bank call centre data, where we observe the exact times of the calls, the dealership data report only the aggregate number of calls per day. For these discretized data, the statistical methods for the former settings are not applicable, so to estimate the periodicities for the Sine model, we use discrete Fourier transform. The counterexample in Appendix C shows that this is suboptimal for estimating frequencies from bucketed arrivals data, so the performances we report here for the sinusoidal NHPP likely underestimate its true performance. Specifically, for the PC model, we regress the daily arrival counts onto a linear trend as well as dummies for the six business days of the week for the dealership. The fitted PC daily arrival rate for day t is then given by the coefficient for the day of the week for t plus the trend effect. For the Sine model, we estimate the frequencies of the arrival pattern by applying discrete Fourier transform to the centered and detrended daily arrival counts.6 The amplitudes and phases for the identified cycles are then estimated by regression jointly with the intercept and the linear trend. Table B.1 ranks the estimated cycles by amplitude. Table B.1. Cycles Identified from the Dealership Data  Staffing in Test Period To evaluate the operational performances of Sine and PC models for staffing, note that we cannot plan staffing at an intraday resolution as in Section 3, because the intraday variation in arrivals cannot be identified from the aggregated data. Hence we consider a setup where the staffing level is set just once a day. This turns out to coincide with the dealership’s staffing policy: If an employee is staffed to work on a particular day, they work for the whole day. For day t in the test period, we model the system as an M/M/ s t +M (Erlang A) queue. Brown et al. (2005, p. 47) demonstrates how theoretical rules implied by this model “hold with reasonable precision” in the real world. The objective is to choose the staffing level st for day t in order to minimize the sum of labor cost and expected customer abandonment cost for that day, that is, C( s t ,λ(t))≔ c salary ⋅ s t +λ(t)⋅P(Ab| s t )⋅P(Conv) ⋅ c profit . ( λ ( ) ) λ ( ) ( b | ) ( ) (B.1) Here, csalary = 230 Turkish lira (TL) is the daily wage for the dealership, λ(t) is the daily arrival rate, P(Ab| s t ) is the conditional steady-state probability of customers leaving the system without being served, P(Conv)=0.10 is the sales conversion rate estimated by the manager, and c profit =4,000 TL is the estimated average profit from a sale (including after-sales services). The average service and patience times are 60 minutes and 10 minutes, respectively. The probability P(Ab| s t ) is estimated using the equation presented in Mandelbaum and Zeltyn (2009). Hence, given a predicted daily arrival rate λ ^ (t) (from either Sine or PC) for day t in the test period, the prescribed staffing level is s ^ t = arg min s C(s, λ ^ (t)) . Its performance is evaluated by C( s ^ t , N t ) , where Nt is the actual number of arrivals on day t. Averaging this over the days in the test period produces an overall performance measure for Sine or PC. We see from Table B.2 that Sine incurs significantly lower cost, in line with Figure 1, which shows that Sine also produces superior predictions for call volumes in the test period. Table B.2. Comparison of NHPP Models for Setting Staffing Levels in the Test Period H1 2017  Appendix C. Counterexample Illustrating Why the Level of Frequency Estimation Precision (A.2) Is Needed We consider a subset of 66,240 patient arrivals to an academic emergency department in the Unites States from 2014 to Q3 of 2015 (T = 652 days of observations). This subset corresponds to patients who are assigned ESI level 2, a measure of emergency severity. The data come from a capacity planning project for the emergency department, and to model patient demand, we fit the sinusoidal NHPP to it. We initially employed a standard discrete Fourier transform to estimate the periodicities in the arrival pattern. This requires bucketing the arrivals into discrete time bins, and the mean bin count in bucket (t,t+Δ] is ∫ t+Δ t λ(t)dt= c 0 Δ+ ∑ k=1 p c ′ k cos(2π ν k t+ ϕ k − π 2 ) + c ′′ k cos(2π ν k t+ ϕ k ) = c 0 Δ+ ∑ k=1 p c ''' k cos(2π ν k t+ ϕ ′ k ), which has the same periodicities as λ(t) . The left panel of Figure C.1 displays the power spectrum for the centred arrival counts bucketed by three-hour intervals. The horizontal axis displays a range of frequencies present in the count data, and the height of a spike is the squared amplitude of the cosine wave with the corresponding frequency. The plot reveals the presence of eight dominant frequencies in the data, the largest one being 1.0015 cycles/day. Figure C.1. (Left) Power Spectrum of ED Arrival Data for ESI Level 2 Patients, Centred to Remove the Zero Frequency Component (Constant Intercept) and (Right) Estimated Arrival Rates over the Course of a Wednesday Note. In the left panel, eight dominant frequencies stand out, the largest one being 1.0015 cycles/day. To fit (1) using just these eight cosines, we reestimate their amplitudes ck and phases ϕ k using least squares. The red dashed line in the right panel of Figure C.1 shows the resulting fit over the course of a Wednesday. Compared with the solid line representing the average hourly arrival count, the estimated arrival rate is essentially flat and completely fails to capture the intraday variation in arrivals. It is surprising that using an approach as standard as the discrete Fourier transform would lead to such discrepancies. In this example, one might guess that the dominant frequency 1.0015 cycles/day is really just a noisy estimate of the daily cycle. Suppose we refit (1) to the seven other frequencies in addition to the daily cycle, that is, we replace 1.0015 cycles/day with 1 cycle/day and keep all other frequencies the same. The blue dotted line in Figure C.1 shows the resulting fit, which is a significant improvement over the previous one. This suggests that the frequency estimation error of 0.0015, which is 1/T=1/652 in this case, is too large. In fact, replacing 1.0015=1+1/T with a slightly more precise estimate of the daily cycle, say, 1+1/(TlogT) , already provides a much more sensible fit (green dashed and dotted line). Why? The amplitude estimation involves regressing the arrival counts onto the explanatory variables {cos(2π ν ^ k t)} 8 k=1 , where ν ^ 1 ,…, ν ^ 8 are the estimated frequencies. Because, in this case, ν ^ 1 =1.0015=1+ T −1 is likely a noisy estimate of ν 1 =1 , using cos(2π ν ^ 1 t) as an explanatory variable in lieu of cos(2π ν 1 t) would result in model misspecification. For example, at time t=T/2 , the bias cos(2π ν ^ 1 t)−cos(2π ν 1 t)=cos{2π(1+ 1 T ) T 2 } −cosπT =−2cosπT does not vanish as T→∞ . Hence, the true amplitude may not be recoverable in the limit. On the other hand, if the precision of ν ^ 1 satisfies (A.2), that is, ν ^ 1 =1+o(1)/T , then the misspecification bias is asymptotically negligible: cos(2π ν ^ 1 t)−cos(2π ν 1 t)=cos{2π(1+ o(1) T ) T 2 } −cosπT =cos{πT+o(1)}−cosπT→0. Although Rice and Rosenblatt (1988) were the first to show that (A.2) is theoretically necessary for ordinary time series, to our knowledge, this is the first real arrivals example to show that the issue actually matters in practice, and is not just a mathematical pathology. In this particular, case one might argue that 1.0015 cycles/day is clearly a noisy estimate for the daily cycle, so the analysis above is unnecessary. However, in general, the “obvious true” frequency may be wrong if the frequency estimate is, say, 1.93 cycles/day: As recounted in Parker (2011), the Allies’ planning of the Normandy landings hinged on understanding the periodicities in tidal heights, which represent the arrival rate of fluid parcels. In a prescient act of patriotism, P. S. Laplace demonstrated mathematically in 1776 that the dominant frequencies are 1.93 cycles/day and 2.00 cycles/day. Without this, the Allies would have had to determine the frequencies empirically instead, and mistakenly rounding 1.93 to 2 might well have changed the course of history. Endnotes 1 If the arrival rate takes on the form of (1), then closed-form expressions for certain performance outcomes can be derived for M t /G/∞, M t /M/ s t +M , and M t /G/ s t +G queues (Eick et al. 1993, Feldman et al. 2008, Liu and Whitt 2012, Liu 2018). 2 See Green and Kolesar (1991), Eick et al. (1993), Jennings et al. (1996), Green et al. (2001), Feldman et al. (2008), Liu and Whitt (2012), Whitt (2014, 2016), Chan et al. (2016), and Liu (2018). 3 Unlike the bank call centre data, where we observe the exact times of the calls, the Turkish dealership data come aggregated at a daily level, so they cannot be used to set staffing at an intraday resolution. Using an alternate setup where staffing is fixed for each day, in Appendix B, we show that staffing with the sinusoidal NHPP also leads to better performance in the test period. 4 It is straightforward to incorporate trends in the sinusoidal and existing NHPP models, as is done for the dealership data in Appendix B. The sinusoidal NHPP remains superior in this setting. 5 Arrival times that have been rounded (e.g., to the nearest second) will require unrounding to remove interarrival times of zero if multiple arrivals are rounded to the same second. We follow Brown et al. (2005) and Kim and Whitt (2014a) in adding uniform random numbers between [0,1] seconds to the timestamps to mitigate the problem. 6 A fine frequency grid is employed, which can be achieved by padding the vector of daily counts with zeroes so that the resulting vector contains 100,000 entries.

The queue evolves according to an external arrival process and a time-varying service process that is a function of the SINR that it experiences. Static configurations of interferers result in infinite queue workload with positive probability. In contrast, a velocity-independent stability condition for the queue is established in the case where interferers possess any non-zero mobility that results in displacements that are both independent across interferers and with a distribution which is invariant to interferer positions. The proof leverages mixing properties of point processes under non-zero mobility. The effects of increasing mobility on statistical averages of queueing metrics are studied, and convex ordering tools are used to establish that faster moving interferers result in a queue workload that is dominated in the increasing convex sense by a queue workload resulting from slower interferers. As a corollary, it is shown that mean queue workload and mean delay improve as network mobility increases. It is shown that there is positive correlation between SINR level-crossing events at finitely separated time points. The notion of correlation between interference over time is made precise via an explicit correlation function. System behaviour is empirically analyzed using discrete-event simulation and the impact of the mobility model on system level performance is evaluated.

The queue is driven by an external arrival process and is subject to a time-varying service process that is a function of the SINR that it sees. Static configurations of interferers result in an infinite queue workload with positive probability. In contrast, a generic stability condition is established for the queue in the case where interferers possess any non-zero mobility that results in displacements that are both independent across interferers and oblivious to interferer positions. The proof leverages the mixing property of the Poisson point process. The effect of an increase in mobility on queuing metrics is also studied. Convex ordering tools are used to establish that faster moving interferers result in a queue workload that is smaller for the increasing-convex stochastic order. As a corollary, mean workload and mean delay decrease as network mobility increases. This stochastic ordering as a function of mobility is explained by establishing positive correlations between SINR level-crossing events at different time points, and by determining the autocorrelation function for interference and observing that it decreases with increasing mobility. System behaviour is empirically analyzed using discrete-event simulation and the performance of various mobility models is evaluated using heavy-traffic approximations.

We develop a game theoretic model to investigate how these insights are affected when the vendor is privately informed about the reliability of a newly developed product. A novel feature of our model is the interaction between reliability signaling (private information) and the vendor’s discretionary investment in spares inventory (private action), which arises naturally in the setting we consider. We find that this interaction leads to contrasting equilibrium outcomes under the two contracts: RBC induces the vendor to focus on inventory savings, leading to underinvestment in spares, whereas PBC induces the vendor to focus on reliability signaling, achieved through overinvestment in inventory. As a result, neither contract is efficient. We investigate two means to mitigate this inefficiency, but either approach has caveats: (a) making inventory verifiable removes the trade-off between reliability signaling and inventory investment, but results in diverging contract preferences between the vendor and the buyer, (b) pooling inventories across multiple buyers saves inventory costs but it also hinders reliability signaling, potentially exacerbating inefficiency.

The operational performance of equipment is determined by joint decisions of the firm (client) and the service provider (vendor). Although some decisions are verifiable and thus directly contractible, many decisions are not. The result is a double-sided moral hazard environment in which each party has incentives to free ride on the other's effort. A performance-based contract allows the client to align the incentives of the vendor, but it also exposes the vendor to stochastic earnings and thereby creates disincentives to make first-best decisions. To capture these issues, we develop a novel principal-agent model by integrating elements of the machine repairman model and a stochastic financial distress model within the double-sided moral hazard framework. We apply our model to solve the client's problem of designing the optimal performance-based contract. We find that the client can attain the first-best profit by restricting the search space to only two classes of performance-based contract structures: linear and tiered. We show that the linear contract structure has limited ability in attaining the first-best outcome, contingent on the vendor's exogenous characteristics. In contrast, the tiered contract structure enables the client to attain the first-best outcome regardless of vendor characteristics. Our results provide normative insights on the role of contract structures in eliminating any loss due to double-sided moral hazard or to the vendor's financial concerns. These results also provide theoretical support for the extensive use of tiered contracts observed in practice.

Service operations management has been a fertile research area addressing strategic, tactical and operational challenges related to service systems. Such problems usually have a complex, dynamic stochastic nature, often leading to models that are both analytically and computationally complicated. In such cases, fluid deterministic models that approximate the dynamics of stochastic/queueing systems can yield accurate and tractable optimization formulations. These formulations enable the construction of intuitive, insightful policies that are implementable in practice, even in time-varying systems. This paper focuses on the applicative aspects of fluid models in addressing various problems in service and healthcare operations management. We review the literature on fluid model applications, discuss the situations in which fluid models are less adequate as well as the implementation of a fluid-based policy into a stochastic discrete system. Lastly, we identify future research opportunities and challenges that have yet to be addressed.

Beyond having their own intrinsic value, these mathematical models are also limits of corresponding many-server stochastic systems. We begin by analyzing a two-station tandem network with a general time-varying arrival rate, a finite waiting room before the first station, and no waiting room between the stations. In this model, customers that are referred from the first station to the second when the latter is saturated (blocked) are forced to wait in the first station while occupying a server there. The finite waiting room before the first station causes customer loss and, therefore, requires reflection analysis. We then specialize our model to a single station (many-server fluid limit of the G_t/M/N/(N +H) queue), generalize it to k stations in tandem, and allow finite internal waiting rooms. Our models yield operational insights into network performance, specifically on the effects of line length, bottleneck location, waiting room size, and the interaction among these effects.

We first demonstrate that parametric forecasts, discretized using Gaussian quadrature, can be used to drive stochastic programs whose results are stable with relatively small numbers of scenarios. We then extend our approach to include forecast updates and two-stage stochastic programs with recourse and provide a general modeling framework for which recent, related models are special cases. In our formulations, the inclusion of multiple arrival-rate scenarios allows call centers to meet long-run average quality-of-service targets, and the use of recourse actions helps them to lower long-run average costs. Experiments with two large sets of call-center data highlight the complementary nature of these elements.

In some cases, they classify customers as high or low value, serving the former with their in-house operations and routing the latter to an outsourcer. Typically, they impose service-level constraints on the time each type of customer waits on hold. This paper considers four schemes for routing low-value calls between the client company and the outsourcer. These schemes vary in the complexity of their routing algorithms, as well as the sophistication of the telephone and information technology infrastructure they require of the two operations. For three of these schemes, this paper provides a direct characterization of system performance. For the fourth, most complex, scheme the paper provides performance bounds for the important special case in which the service requirements of high- and low-value callers are the same. These results allow the systematic comparison of the performance of the various routing schemes. The results suggest that, for clients with large outsourcing requirements, the simpler schemes that require little client-outsourcer coordination can perform very well.

The proposed design emerges as a synthesis of text analytics and predictive machine learning methods. Using numerical experiments based on the simulation of the firm's contact center, we demonstrate the service level, time, and labor cost benefits of the automated design over two other triage designs (i.e., customer choice triage and human expert triage) that are commonly employed in the real world. Through additional analyses, we explore the generalizability of the automated design for creating solutions for different types of communication channels. Our work has implications for managing customer relations under emerging communication technologies (e.g., live-chat, e-mail, and social media) and more broadly for demonstrating the use of text analytics and machine learning to improve Operations Management practice.

In fact, this is a well-established result in the literature when jobs cannot make decisions and servers and jobs are identical. An important corollary of this finding is that pooling queues improves social welfare in the aforementioned setting. We consider an observable multiserver queueing system that can be operated with either dedicated queues or a pooled one. Customers are delay-sensitive, and they decide to join or balk based on queue length information upon arrival, they are not subject to an external admission control. In this setting, we prove that, contrary to the common understanding, pooling queues can increase the long-run average sojourn time so much that the pooled system results in strictly smaller social welfare (and strictly smaller consumer surplus) than the dedicated system under certain conditions. Specifically, pooling queues hurts performance when the arrival-rate-to-service-rate ratio is large (e.g., greater than one) and the normalized service benefit is also large. We prove that the performance loss due to pooling queues can be significant. Our numerical studies demonstrate that pooling queues can decrease the social welfare (and consumer surplus) by more than 95%. The benefit of pooling is commonly believed to increase with system size. In contrast, we show that when delay-sensitive customers make rational joining decisions, the magnitude of the performance loss due to pooling can strictly increase with the system size.

In a typical SLA, a target ready rate is periodically measured and a financial penalty is incurred if this target is not met. The ready rate considered in this study is defined as the long-run fraction of periods in which all customer demand is filled immediately from on-hand stock. Previous studies of SLAs have been solely concerned with one supplier serving one-customer, whereas in practice a supplier usually deals with more than one-customer. In multiple-customer cases, the supplier has an SLA with each customer and a penalty is incurred whenever the agreement is violated. In this work, we examine the impacts of various factors such as the base-stock level, the type of penalty and the review period duration on the supplier’s cost function when the supplier deals with multiple-customers. The results show that dealing with more customers is preferable for a supplier (assuming the overall demand is the same) and that a longer performance review phase is beneficial under a lump-sum penalty contract.

The design of flexibility in terms of agents' skill sets and assignments of requests is a critical issue for such systems. The objective of this study was to identify preferred flexibility structures when demand is random and capacity is finite. We compare structures recommended by the flexibility literature to structures we observe in practice within call centers. To enable a comparison of flexibility structures under optimal capacity, the capacity optimization problem for this setting is formulated as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem. A simulation-based optimization procedure for this problem using sample-path gradient estimation is proposed and tested, and used in the subsequent comparison of the flexibility structures being studied. The analysis illustrates under what conditions on demand, cost, and human resource considerations, the structures found in practice are preferred.

The service provider receives an uncertain call volume over multiple periods and is considering outsourcing all or part of these calls to a contractor. Each call brings in a fixed revenue to the service provider. Answering calls requires having service capacity, thus implicit in the outsourcing decision is a capacity decision. Insufficient capacity implies that calls cannot be answered, which in turn means there will be a revenue loss. Faced with a choice between a volume-based and a capacity-based contract offered by a contractor that has pricing power, the service provider determines optimal capacity levels. The optimal price and capacity of the contractor together with the optimal capacity of the service provider determine optimal profits of each party under the two contracts being considered. This paper characterizes optimal capacity levels and partially characterizes optimal pricing decisions under each contract. The impact of demand variability and the economic parameters on contract choice are explored through numerical examples. It is shown that no contract type is universally preferred and that operating environments as well as cost-revenue structures have an important effect.

Our proposed control activates serving some customers from the other system when a ratio of the two queue lengths (numbers of waiting customers) exceeds a threshold. Two thresholds, one for each direction of sharing, automatically detect the overload condition and prevent undesired sharing under normal loads. After a threshold has been exceeded, the control aims to keep the ratio of the two queue lengths at a specified value. To gain insight, we introduce an idealized stochastic model with two customer classes and two associated service pools containing large numbers of agents. To set the important queue-ratio parameters, we consider an approximating deterministic fluid model. We determine queue-ratio parameters that minimize convex costs for this fluid model. We perform simulation experiments to show that the control is effective for the original stochastic model. Indeed, the simulations show that the proposed queue-ratio control with thresholds outperforms the optimal fixed partition of the servers given known fixed arrival rates during the overload, even though the proposed control does not use information about the arrival rates.

We assume that the two systems are designed to operate independently, but want to help each other respond to unexpected overloads. The proposed overload control automatically activates sharing (sending some customers from one system to the other) once a ratio of the queue lengths in the two systems crosses an activation threshold (with ratio and activation threshold parameters for each direction). In this paper, we are primarily concerned with ensuring that the system recovers rapidly after the overload is over, either because (i) the two systems return to normal loading or (ii) the direction of the overload suddenly shifts in the opposite direction. To achieve rapid recovery, we introduce lower thresholds for the queue ratios, below which one-way sharing is released. As a basis for studying the complex dynamics, we develop a new six-dimensional fluid approximation for a system with time-varying arrival rates, extending a previous fluid approximation involving a stochastic averaging principle. We conduct simulations to confirm that the new algorithm is effective for predicting the system performance and choosing effective control parameters. The simulation and the algorithm show that the system can experience an inefficient nearly periodic behavior, corresponding to an oscillating equilibrium (congestion collapse) if the sharing is strongly inefficient and the control parameters are set inappropriately.

These indicators may differ from system to system according to its nature. Basically, call centers can be characterized as stochastic systems that could be modeled mathematically using queueing models (QM). This paper introduces a methodology for evaluating call centers performance using queueing models (QM) with and without customer abandonment, and studies the impact of abandonment rate as a metric of evaluating call center performance. In addition to, introduce a framework of the proposed methodology and a case study for three models. The propose methodology is implemented and analyzed on real benchmark datasets.

These define service measures such as what constitutes an acceptable delay or an acceptable abandonment rate. They may also dictate penalties for failing to meet agreed-upon targets. We introduce a period-based SLA that measures performance over a short duration such as a rush hour. We compare it to alternate SLAs that measure service by individual and over a long horizon. To measure the service levels for these SLAs, we develop several approximations. We approximate the probability an acceptable delay is met by generalizing the heavy-traffic quality and efficiency driven regime. We also provide a new approximation for the abandonment rate. Further, we prove a central limit theorem for the probability of meeting a service level measured by the percentage of customers acceptably served during a period. We demonstrate how an outsourced call center operating in an environment with uncertain demand and abandonment can determine its staffing policy to maximize the expected profit for these SLAs. Numerical experiments demonstrate a high degree of accuracy for the approximations and the resulting staffing levels. We indicate several salient features of the behavior of the period-based SLA.

While work-conserving policies are optimal for macrolevel measures, scheduling policies with strategic idleness (SI) might be helpful for microlevel measures. Using the empirical data obtained from the service provider, we provide statistical evidence that SI is used by its schedulers to manage the macro- and microlevel measures. However, the company has no specific rules on implementing SI and the schedulers make decisions based on their own experience. Our primary goal is to develop a systematic framework for the joint usage of SI with dynamic scheduling policies (DSPs). We suggest to use threshold-based policies to intelligently combine SI and DSPs and show that the resulting policies provide an efficient way to simultaneously address both macro- and microlevel measures. We build two simulation models: one based on empirical data and one based on a randomly generated open-shop network. We use both models to demonstrate that an open-shop service network can be systematically and effectively managed to deliver improved service level by using SI.

The thesis is written in English and is available from the author upon request. This work deals with the comparison of simulation-based algorithms for solving the agents scheduling problem in a multiskill call center minimizing their costs under service levels constraints. A solution approach, combining simulation, with integer or linear programming, and cut generation, is proposed. Considering realistic problems, it performs better than the two-step approach proposed in the literature. It is also shown that a randomized search, extending the one defined for the single-period staffing problem in Avramidis et al. [IIE Trans (in press), 2008], yields highly suboptimal solutions. Finally, an extension of the cutting plane method to directly control the probability on the customers abandonments is designed.

We allow customers to be impatient, that is one customer may leave the system before beginning service. We focus on scheduling policies that assign customers, upon arrival, to parallel queues, high and low priority queues. The policies are developed subject to satisfying constraints on performances related to the fraction of customers served, the mean and the variance of the waiting time in queue. We analyze several dynamic scheduling policies in order to meet our objective. These policies are characterized to be simple and easy to implement in practice

We specifically consider theaters where demand at concession stands is non-stationary, being largely dominated by the showtimes, the days of the week and the movie types. Determination of the number of workers and their shift in such facilities can be considered as a venue management problem. As one of the distinctive characteristics of our study, we maximize the expected contribution of venue operations while combining shift scheduling in a mathematical model. In addition to the objective function, shift scheduling differs from that in the standard literature, as shift beginning and end times are not restricted. Because of the highly variable demand in the venue management problem considered, flexible shifts are used, with flexible beginning and end times, as long as workers meet the specifications of the type to which they belong. We prove that the venue management problem under consideration is NP-complete. Under mild conditions, we show that the binary requirements of some of the variables in the model can be relaxed. Computational results of a case study are provided.

Lack of service inventories, the inability to backlog demand and significant shortage and overage costs complicate the problem. In such situations, outsourcing all or part of the demand to third-party vendors provides a viable and cost effective option for the firm. Motivated by the remittance processing operations of a Fortune 100 company we examine the usefulness of complementing in-house staffing with different outsourcing arrangements. We study capacity-based and volume-based contracts between a financial services firm and an outsourcing vendor. We examine the impact of demand characteristics on the parameters of contract choice. Through extensive numerical analysis, we ascertain that neither contract is universally preferred, but cost and revenue structures along with demand characteristics determine contract choice.

A case in point is simulation-based optimization of complex systems. An obvious idea to push the improvement one step further is to combine several VRTs for a given simulation. But such combinations often give rise to new issues. This paper studies the combination of stratification with control variates. We detail and compare several ways of doing the combination. Nontrivial synergies between the two methods are exhibited. We illustrate this with a telephone call centre simulation, where we combine a control variate with stratification with respect to one of the uniform random variates that drive the simulation. It turns out that using more information in the control variate degrades the performance (significantly) in our example. This seemingly paradoxical behaviour is not rare and our theoretical analysis explains why.

We model the relationship between capacity, QoS and prices offered by service providers in a competitive network services market. We establish sufficient conditions for existence of Nash equilibrium in the multi-class queueing game. We also explore characterization of inefficiency in the multi-class queueing game model. The modeling framework we provide can be used to study important properties of the equilibrium solution which may be exploited to provide useful guidelines for performance planning and pricing strategies for firms competing in network resource markets.

In particular, the forecasting system is a recurrent fuzzy-neural model. The premise and defuzzification parts of the model’s fuzzy rules are static, while the consequent parts of the fuzzy rules are small block-diagonal recurrent neural networks with internal feedback, thus enabling the overall system to discover the temporal dependencies of the telecommunications time-series and perform forecasting without requiring prior knowledge of the exact order of the time-series. The forecasting performance is evaluated by using real-world telecommunications data. An extensive comparative analysis with a series of existing forecasters is conducted, including both traditional models as well as computational intelligence’s approaches. The simulation results confirm the modelling potential of the proposed scheme, since the latter outperforms its competing rivals in terms of three appropriate metrics, in all kinds of calls.

This study investigated motivations, practices, perceived benefits, and barriers to outsourcing by general hospitals in Uganda. An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was used. Quantitative data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire from managers in 32 randomly selected hospitals. Qualitative data were latter collected from eight purposively selected managers using an interview guide. Quantitative data were statistically analyzed using SAS 9.3. Qualitative data were managed using ATLAS ti 7 and coded manually, and content analysis was conducted. Quantitative findings indicate that outsourcing of support services was prevalent (72% of hospitals). The key motivation for outsourcing was to gain access to quality service (68%). Limited availability of service providers was a key challenge during outsourcing (57%). Managers perceive improved productivity and better services as key benefits of outsourcing (90%). The main barrier to outsourcing is limited financing. These findings were confirmed and explained by the qualitative data. Findings and recommendations from this study are critical in developing interventions to encourage effective outsourcing by hospitals in Uganda and other developing countries.

Thus, similarly to the manufacturing industries, the productivity of building components can fluctuate owing to human errors and machine malfunctions. Since the site demand must always be met, manufacturing is at times outsourced to supplement uncertainties in production. Furthermore, a storage facility between the factory and the construction site becomes indispensable to deal with components that are large in size, yielding a three-tier supply chain that is absent in traditional construction. The objective of this research is to determine the most appropriate production plan and the optimal outsourcing quantities for multi-prefabricated components produced in a manufacturing environment subject to uncertainties in productivity. A workflow including a two-stage stochastic programming model and a mixed integer linear programming model is established to resolve the above issues. The most favourable schemes for dispatching components and the variation of inventory are also determined. A large infrastructure built through the prefabrication method was selected as a case study to validate the models. Keywords Logistic Manufactured construction Outsourcing manufacturing

To gain insights into reducing this waiting time, we study operations in the inpatient wards and their interface with the ED. We focus on understanding the effect of inpatient discharge policies and other operational policies on the time-of-day waiting time performance, such as the fraction of patients waiting longer than six hours in the ED before being admitted. Based on an empirical study at a Singaporean hospital, we propose a novel stochastic processing network with the following characteristics to model inpatient operations: (1) A patient’s service time in the inpatient wards depends on that patient’s admission and discharge times and length of stay. The service times capture a two-time-scale phenomenon and are not independent and identically distributed. (2) Pre- and post-allocation delays model the extra amount of waiting caused by secondary bottlenecks other than bed unavailability, such as nurse shortage. (3) Patients waiting for a bed can overflow to a nonprimary ward when the waiting time reaches a threshold, where the threshold is time dependent. We show, via simulation studies, that our model is able to capture the inpatient flow dynamics at hourly resolution and can evaluate the impact of operational policies on both the daily and time-of-day waiting time performance. In particular, our model predicts that implementing a hypothetical policy can eliminate excessive waiting for those patients who request beds in mornings. This policy incorporates the following components: a discharge distribution with the first discharge peak between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 26% of patients discharging before noon, and constant-mean allocation delays throughout the day. The insights gained from our model can help hospital managers to choose among different policies to implement depending on the choice of objective, such as to reduce the peak waiting in the morning or to reduce daily waiting time statistics.

This enhances the substantial developments made by goal setting theory but concentrates on goal achievement rather than simply goal setting. Whilst goal intentions specify what a person wants to achieve, implementation intention specifies the behaviour to be performed and the situational context it is to be performed in. This is a qualitative study based on a management development program being delivered in one UK Higher Education Institute. Data was collected from reflective learning journals and semi structured interviews with 15 participants. Findings indicate that the use of an implementation intention statement encouraged transfer in 67% of the participants. This is a higher figure than any other study not using implementation intentions, has previously recorded. This study therefore advances scholarship in the field of Human Resource Development (HRD) and especially transfer of training. It also provides practical utility for organisations looking to gain a return from their investment in HRD.

Several people may call to report the same fire or the same accident, for example. Such a sudden burst of incoming traffic can have a significant impact on the responsiveness of the call center for other events in the same period of time. We examine data from the SOS Alarm center in Sweden. We also build a stochastic model for the bursts. We show how to estimate the model parameters for each burst by maximum likelihood, how to model the multivariate distribution of those parameters using copulas, and how to simulate the burst process from this model. In our model, certain events trigger an arrival process of calls with a random time-varying rate over a finite period of time of random length.

Although the pooled structure, known to minimize the servers’ idle time, is widely used in large-scale service systems, this study reveals that the dedicated structure, along with the join-the-shortest-queue routing policy, could be more advantageous for improving certain performance measures, such as the probability of a customer’s waiting time being within a delay target. The servers’ additional idleness resulting from the dedicated structure will be negligible when the system scale is large. Using a fluid model substantiated by asymptotic analysis, we provide a performance comparison between the two structures for a moderately overloaded queueing system with customer abandonment. We intend to help service system designers answer the following question: To reach a specified service-level target, which queue structure will be more cost effective? Aside from structure design, our results are of practical value for performance analysis and staffing deployment.

This study aimed to determine the reasons for outsourcing, outsourced services, achieved objectives, and outsourcing challenges. This qualitative study was conducted through 58 face-to-face semi-structured interviews with chief executive officers (CEOs), chief financial officers (CFOs), and contracting experts (CEs) in 42 public hospitals in Tehran, Iran. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used. Interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis was performed based on an inductive-deductive approach via MAXQDA-10. The Participants included 26 CEOs, 15 CFOs, and 17 CEs. The most important reasons for outsourcing were divided into four main categories including financial resources and funding, customers, management, and factors related to the hospitals. Accessing to up-to-date knowledge and technology, improving service quality and accountability, focusing on strategic points, reducing workload, and increasing patient satisfaction turned out to be the positive outcomes of outsourcing. Weakness in laws and regulations, monitoring and assessment of an outsourced unit, creating dependency and changing organizational culture, as well as human resource issues were introduced as the main pitfalls and challenges of outsourcing. Based on the results, it was suggested that the hospital managers must attempt to outsource services by realistic analysis of the organization's current status. They should specify the reasons and objectives of outsourcing and make decisions based on outsourcing potentials. By taking the current challenges of outsourcing in Iranian hospitals into account, the authorities can make the most efficient decisions with regard to outsourcing.
Qi Feng,  Lauren Xiaoyuan Lu;2013;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12026;The Role of Contract Negotiation and Industry Structure in Production Outsourcing;Production and Operations Management;https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12026;96;wiley;ren_zhou_et_al_2008;True;1059-1478;A;Abstract Despite the spread of cost-driven outsourcing practices, academic research cautions that suppliers' cost advantage may weaken manufacturers' bargaining positions in negotiating outsourcing agreements, thereby hurting their profitability. In this study, we attempt to further understand the strategic impact of low-cost outsourcing on manufacturers' profitability by investigating the contractual form of outsourcing agreements and the industry structure of the upstream supply market. We consider a two-tier supply chain system, consisting of two competing manufacturers, who have the option to produce in-house or to outsource to an upstream supplier with lower cost. To reach an outsourcing agreement, each manufacturer engages in bilateral negotiation with her supplier, who may be an exclusive supplier or a common supplier serving both manufacturers. Our analysis shows that wholesale-price contracts always mitigate the competition between manufacturers regardless of whether they compete with price or quantity. In contrast, two-part tariffs intensify the competition when the manufacturers compete with quantity, but soften it when they compete with price. As a result, when outsourcing with two-part tariffs, the manufacturers may earn lower profits than they would from in-house production, although the suppliers are more cost efficient. This suggests that managers have to be wary about the downside of using coordinating contracts such as two-part tariffs when pursuing low-cost outsourcing strategies. Our analysis also sheds some light on the profitability of using an exclusive supplier for outsourcing. When outsourcing with wholesale-price contracts, the competing manufacturers are better off outsourcing to an exclusive supplier. However, when outsourcing with two-part tariffs, the manufacturers may earn higher profits by outsourcing to a common supplier than to an exclusive one when the manufacturers' bargaining power is sufficiently strong (weak) under quantity (price) competition.

One fundamental question yet to be addressed is whether upstream suppliers' cost efficiency is always beneficial to downstream manufacturers in the presence of competition and negotiations. In other words, does low cost outsourcing always lead to a win–win outcome? To answer this question, we adopt a multiunit bilateral bargaining framework to investigate competing manufacturers' sourcing decisions. We analyze two supply chain structures: one-to-one channels, in which each manufacturer may outsource to an exclusive supplier, and one-to-two channels, in which each manufacturer may outsource to a common supplier. We show that, under both structures, low cost outsourcing may lead to a win–lose outcome in which the suppliers gain and the manufacturers lose. This happens because suppliers' cost advantage may backfire on competing manufacturers through two negative effects. First, a decrease of upstream cost weakens a manufacturer's bargaining position by reducing her disagreement payoff (i.e., her insourcing profit) because the competing manufacturer can obtain a low cost position through outsourcing. Second, in one-to-two channels, the common supplier's bargaining position is strengthened with a lower cost because his disagreement payoff increases (i.e., his profit from serving only one manufacturer increases). The endogeneity of disagreement payoffs in our model highlights the importance of modeling firm negotiations under competition. Moreover, we identify an interesting bargaining externality between competing manufacturers when they outsource to a common supplier. Because the supplier engages in two negotiations, his share of profit from the trade with one manufacturer affects the total surplus of the trade with the other manufacturer. Because of this externality, surprisingly, as a manufacturer's bargaining power decreases, her profit under outsourcing may increase and it may be more likely for her to outsource.

In the process of forecasting, due that the raw sequence consisted of product form feature points’ positions has the characteristics of poor sample, irregular and high volatility, firstly the traditional grey model is improved to be more suitable for the oscillating raw data, and the improved grey model is combined with BP NN for the purpose of enhancing the mutual influence between anterior and posterior data in sequence, in addition Markov chain is used to amend the final prediction results. The radiator grill profile of a certain type of automobile are taken as an example, the results of the IGMBPM model are compared with other models, the former shows better performance, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In addition to the purely random fluctuations, there is also typically a predictable pattern in the number of arriving patients. For example, roughly 2/3 of the admitted patients at an Intensive Care Unit arrives during office hours. Also, most of the scheduled admissions occur during weekdays instead of during the weekend. Using approximations based on the infinite-server queue, we analyze an M t /H/s/s model to determine the impact of the time-dependent arrival pattern on the required number of operational beds and fraction of refused admissions for clinical wards. In particular, the results show that the effect of the daily pattern is rather limited for clinical wards in contrast to the week-weekend pattern, for which the difference in the fraction of refused admissions across the week is considerable. We also show that an increased variability in length of stay distribution has a stabilizing effect on the time-dependent required number of beds. Finally, we demonstrate a method to determine the required number of beds across the week.

The first model deals with a single server that continuously adapts its service rate based on the waiting time of the first customer in line. In the second model, one queue is served by a primary server which is supplemented by a secondary server when the waiting of the first customer in line exceeds a threshold. Using level crossings for the waiting-time process of the first customer in line, we derive steady-state waiting-time distributions for both models. The results are illustrated with numerical examples.

The simulation-optimization problem is that of locating a real-valued function's minimum, again with only a stochastic simulation that generates function estimates. Retrospective approximation (RA) is a sample-path technique for solving such problems, where the solution to the underlying problem is approached via solutions to a sequence of approximate deterministic problems, each of which is generated using a specified sample size, and solved to a specified error tolerance. Our primary focus, in this paper, is providing guidance on choosing the sequence of sample sizes and error tolerances in RA algorithms. We first present an overview of the conditions that guarantee the correct convergence of RA's iterates. Then we characterize a class of error-tolerance and sample-size sequences that are superior to others in a certain precisely defined sense. We also identify and recommend members of this class and provide a numerical example illustrating the key results.

However, parameters of those models can be time-dependent. For example, the arrival rate and the staffing level significantly vary over the day in call centres. In manufacturing, additional production lines are put into operation or workers gain experience over time. Another application is the adjustment of buffer capacities in between machines, for example via dynamic KANBAN control. Such systems can be modelled as time-dependent queues where one or several parameters change over time. Exact analytical approaches for performance analysis are known under certain assumptions. However, approximation methods are often applied to analyse performance measures over time, see the survey [7]. Even though time-dependent performance analysis is challenging by itself, an additional fruitful direction of research is the optimization of parameters of time-dependent queueing systems.

This paper first proposes discrete-time models for approximating the patient waiting times for any given ED staffing. The waiting time approximation is based on three simple ideas: the separation of patients served in a period and patients overflowed, the combination of M/M/c approximation for patients served and waiting time analysis of overflow patients, and the transformation of the performance evaluation into an optimization problem with the number of overflow patients as decision variables. The resulting waiting time approximations are then integrated into ED staffing optimization models, and variable neighborhood search algorithms are developed to solve the ED staffing models. Numerical experiments with real-life data from Chinese hospitals are performed to validate the proposed models and algorithms. The results show that the proposed methodology is able to significantly reduce the total waiting time of patients without increasing staff capacity.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the impact of these sources of variability on the required amount of capacity and to determine admission quota for scheduled admissions to regulate the occupancy pattern. For the impact of variability on the required number of beds, we use a heavy-traffic limit theorem for the G/G/∞ queue yielding an intuitively appealing approximation in case the arrival process is not Poisson. Also, given a structural weekly admission pattern, we apply a time-dependent analysis to determine the mean offered load per day. This time-dependent analysis is combined with a Quadratic Programming model to determine the optimal number of elective admissions per day, such that an average desired daily occupancy is achieved. From the mathematical results, practical scenarios and guidelines are derived that can be used by hospital managers and support the method of quota scheduling. In practice, the results can be implemented by providing admission quota prescribing the target number of admissions for each patient group.

In this study, we investigate how demand for care and support fluctuates over time and during the course of a day, using demand data from three independent nursing home departments of a single Dutch nursing home. This demand data is used as input for an optimization model that provides optimal staffing patterns across the day. For the optimization we use a Lindley-type equation and techniques from stochastic optimization to formulate a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. The impact of both the current and proposed staffing patterns, in terms of waiting time and service level, are investigated. The results show substantial improvements for all three departments both in terms of average waiting time as well as in 15 minutes service level. Especially waiting during rush hours is significantly reduced, whereas there is only a slight increase in waiting time during non-rush hours.

However, full flexibility can have some major drawbacks as large systems are more difficult to manage, lack effective care delivery due to absence of focus and require multi-skilled medical teams. In this paper, we identify practical guidelines on how beds should be allocated to provide both flexibility and utilize specialization. Specifically, small scale systems can often benefit from full flexibility. Threshold type of control is then effective to prioritize patient types and to cope with patients having diverse lengths of stay. For large scale systems, we assert that a little flexibility is generally sufficient to take advantage of most of the economies of scale. Bed reservation (earmarking) or, equivalently, organizing a shared ward of overflow, then performs well. The theoretical models and guidelines are illustrated with numerical examples. Moreover, we address a key question stemming from practice: how to distribute a fixed number of hospital beds over the different units?

Participants identified opportunities for process improvement, collected baseline measures on how (and how well) the IT Department was providing support services, and jointly developed a preliminary solution centered on a new team-based organization of support services. Rather than forwarding service requests to groups of support staff organized by IT application type, service requests would now be resolved on-the-spot by a team with distributed knowledge of multiple applications. Six and twelve months post-intervention, there was some evidence of success, including performance improvement and staff buy-in. We use realistic evaluation as an organizing framework to describe potential links between the intervention content and process, the surrounding context, and the outcomes of the intervention. We hypothesize four mechanisms that mediate this link: work standardization, connections between people, seamless flow, and participatory problem solving. We conclude that other organizations can learn as much from ThedaCare's participatory rapid improvement process and Lean approach to transformational change as from the actual implemented changes.

So, ensuring optimized personnel schedules in call centers has several advantages, such as reduced total labor costs, overstaffing, increased employee satisfaction, and acceptable waiting times. In this paper, we address the personnel scheduling problem in a 24/7 call center where the scheduling process is done manually. So, the main goal is to explore exact solution approaches to achieve better solutions while reducing the processing time. The proposed optimization model is an Integer Programming model to assign shifts to workers while minimizing the total penalization associated with employees’ time preferences. The model is tested with several instances, including randomly generated and real-world data instances. The quality of the model is assessed through a computational study of its linear relaxation, concluding that the model presents null integrality gaps in all the tested instances. Additionally, to evaluate the performance of the model when running large instances, several randomly generated instances were tested, achieving good computational results.

They are strategic tools to establish a relationship with customers to promote customer satisfaction, which can lead to an increase in customer loyalty and sales. One important factor impacting customer satisfaction is service reliability, which should be constantly monitored to enhance customer satisfaction. This paper uses a systems thinking approach to investigate contact centers from a systems perspective. We aim to provide a holistic view of the customer support process to help decision makers infer transformations in the system. We present an architecture of the contact center operations management system incorporating concepts of systems engineering, and describe its components and functions. The systems perspective to contact center processes facilitates developing a customer service reliability model. Since the reliability metric takes into account the fundamentals of the contact center processes and key input data, the modeling approach can dynamically adapt to changes in the contact center processes and data. The developed system architecture and reliability metric are general and adaptable to be expanded to other domains. An empirical analysis using data from a major insurance company is provided to illustrate the applicability of the system design, reliability, and performance control using a control chart.

However, companies face the challenge of measuring and evaluating how new technology will impact operational processes. This article takes a systems engineering approach to assess the tradeoffs of adopting data-driven mechanisms to improve operational processes in a multichannel customer support system. In this article, we investigate potential cost savings from two technology applications: classification methods to direct customers to efficient self-service communication channels and routing methods to match customers with agents based on the query type and available skill set. Discrete event simulation evaluates how new technology adoption affects system-level performance. What-if scenarios combine distinct configurations of customer classification mechanisms and available communication channels to evaluate the reduction in the total number of agents required to meet a target service quality level. Discussion includes practical examples of how operational managers could use experimental information to make strategic operational decisions when adopting data-driven technologies.

The models considered are (i) a benchmark fixed-effects model that does not exploit any dependence structures in the data, (ii) a mixed-effects model that takes into account both interday (day-to-day) and intraday (within-day) correlations, and (iii) two new bivariate mixed-effects models, for the joint distribution of the arrival counts to two separate queues, that exploit correlations between different call types. Our study shows the importance of accounting for different correlation structures in the data.

These models are used both for simulation and to forecast incoming call volumes to make staffing decisions and build (or update) work schedules for agents who answer those calls. Commercial software and call center managers usually base their decisions solely on point forecasts, given in the form of mathematical expectations (conditional on current information), but distributional forecasts, which come in the form of (conditional) probability distributions, are generally more useful, in particular in the context of simulation. Building realistic models is not simple, because arrival rates are themselves stochastic, time-dependent, dependent across time periods and across call types, and are often affected by external events. As an illustration, we evaluate the forecasting accuracy of selected models in an empirical study with real-life call center data.

The core of our framework is a multi-class Erlang loss model that represents ventilator use by both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Input for the model includes COVID-19 case projections, and our analysis incorporates projections with different levels of transmission due to public health measures and social distancing. We incorporated data from the BC Intensive Care Unit Database to calibrate and validate the model. Using discrete event simulation, we projected ventilator access, including when capacity would be reached and how many patients would be unable to access a ventilator. Simulation results were compared with three numerical approximation methods, namely pointwise stationary approximation, modified offered load, and fixed point approximation. Using this comparison, we developed a hybrid optimization approach to efficiently identify required ventilator capacity to meet access targets. Model projections demonstrate that public health measures and social distancing potentially averted up to 50 deaths per day in BC, by ensuring that ventilator capacity was not reached during the first wave of COVID-19. Without these measures, an additional 173 ventilators would have been required to ensure that at least 95% of patients can access a ventilator immediately. Our model enables policy makers to estimate critical care utilization based on epidemic projections with different transmission levels, thereby providing a tool to quantify the interplay between public health measures, necessary critical care resources, and patient access indicators.

We consider a variety of contracts, all based on our observations of contracts used by one large vendor. We examine the role of different contract features such as pay-per-time, pay-per-call, service-level agreements, and constraints on service rates and abandonment. We show how different combinations of these contract features enable client firms to better manage vendors when there is information asymmetry about worker productivity. In particular, we focus on how different contracts can coordinate by yielding the system-optimal capacity decision by the vendor and consider how profits are allocated between the client and the vendor.

The construction of such a schedule will have a direct impact on the quality of service and the finances of this call center. Of great importance is knowing when and how to assess this agent schedule despite the uncertainties of how the day will actually unfold. The answers to these questions and their contribution to maintaining a certain level of performance are explored. Through discrete-event simulation, we were able to simulate different agent schedules of a call center for the disabled community, anonymized as the abbreviation ANGUS. Our results indicate the capability of evaluating schedules based on the simulation's predicted outcomes. With such insight, it is indeed possible to meet the performance criteria objectives developed by ANGUS.

Moreover, unpredictability is a significant issue in these environments as it often forces passengers to arrive earlier than necessary ""just in case."" Unfortunately, we rarely know the precise form of the arrival process and must use observed samples to set the staffing policy.

The method consists of two steps. First, staffing levels are determined, and next, in the second step, the outcomes are used as input for the scheduling problem. The scheduling problem relies on a linear programming model that is easy to implement and has short computation times, i.e., a fraction of a second. Therefore, it is useful for different purposes and it can be part of an iterative procedure: for example, one that combines shifts into rosters.

For this type of problem, typically, no single deterministic and stationary (i.e., state independent and easily implementable) policy yields the optimal control, and mixed strategies are used. Other than finding the optimal mixed strategy, we propose to optimize the performance over the set of “balanced” deterministic periodic non-stationary policies. We provide a stochastic approximation algorithm that allows to find the optimal balanced policy by means of Monte Carlo simulation. As illustrated by numerical examples, the optimal balanced policy outperforms the optimal mixed strategy.

We propose a model which identifies the right mix of biomass to optimize the performance of the thermochemical conversion process at the minimum cost. This is a chance-constraint programming (CCP) model which takes into account the stochastic nature of biomass quality. The proposed CCP model ensures that process requirements, which are impacted by physical and chemical properties of biomass, are met most of the time. We consider two problem settings, a centralized and a decentralized supply chain. We propose a mixed-integer linear program to model the blending problem in the centralized setting and a bilevel program to model the blending problem in the decentralized setting. We use the sample average approximation method to approximate the chance constraints, and propose solution algorithms to solve this approximation. We develop a case study for South Carolina using data provided by the Billion Ton Study. Based on our results, the blends identified consist mainly of pine and softwood residues. The blends identified and the suppliers selected by both models are different. The cost of the centralized supply chain is 2%–6% lower. The implications of these results are twofold. First, these results could lead to improved collaborations in the supply chain. Second, these results provide an estimate of the approximation error from assuming centralized decision making in the supply chain.

To minimize the impact of disruptions, a proper incentive mechanism has to be in place so that the suppliers provide prompt restoration and recovery services to the customer. A widely adopted incentive mechanism is performance-based contracting (PBC), in which suppliers receive compensation based on realized system uptime. A key obstacle is that disruptions occur infrequently, making it very expensive for a supplier to commit the necessary resources for recovery because they will be idle most of the time. In this paper, we show that designing a successful PBC creates nontrivial challenges that are unique to this environment. Namely, because of the infrequent and random nature of disruptions, a seemingly innocuous choice of performance measures used in contracts may create unexpected incentives, resulting in counterintuitive optimal behavior. We compare the efficiencies of two widely used contracts, one based on sample-average downtime and the other based on cumulative downtime, and identify the supplier's ability to influence the frequency of disruptions as an important factor in determining which contract performs better. We also show that implementing PBC may create high agency cost when equipment is very reliable. This counterintuitive situation arises because the realized downtimes from which the customer might intuit about the supplier's capacity investment are highly uncertain when there are not many samples of downtimes, i.e., when disruptions occur rarely.

Although organizations are increasingly using these resources, the relationship between flexible labor resources and financial performance has not been examined empirically in the service setting. We use two years of archival data from 445 stores of a large retailer to study this relationship. We hypothesize and find that increasing the labor mix of temporary or part-time workers shows an inverted U-shaped relationship with sales and profit while temporary labor mix has a U-shaped relationship with expenses. Thus, although flexible labor resources can create volume flexibility for a firm along multiple dimensions, it is possible to have too much of a good thing.

Unfortunately there are no control strategies available which take this into account. Instead standard strategies like First Come First Served are applied which lead to systems tending to exhibit long queues and high volatility, even though these strategies perform well in the case of uncorrelated processes. So, there is a strong need for control strategies managing autocorrelated arrival processes. Accordingly this paper introduces HAFI (Highest Autocorrelated First), a new strategy which determines the processes' priority in accordance to their autocorrelation. The paper focuses on controlling autocorrelated arrival processes at a merge. The strategies First Come First Served and Longest Queue First will serve as reference. As a result and in respect to properly designed facilities, HAFI leads to comparatively short queues and waiting times as well as balanced 95 th percentile values of the queue lengths of autocorrelated input processes.

Customer orders must be fulfilled with short lead times to ensure high customer satisfaction, and the costly under-utilization of workers must be avoided. To approach this ideal, forecasting order quantities with high accuracy is essential. Many drivers of online sales, including seasonality, special promotions and public holidays, are well known, and they have been frequently incorporated into forecasting approaches. However, the impact of weather on e-commerce operations has not been rigorously analyzed. In this study, we integrate weather data into the sales forecasting of the largest European online fashion retailer. We find that sunshine, temperature, and rain have a significant impact on daily sales, particularly in the summer, on weekends, and on days with extreme weather. Using weather forecasts, we have significantly improved sales forecast accuracy. We find that including weather data in the sales forecast model can lead to fewer sales forecast errors, reducing them by, on average, 8.6% to 12.2% and up to 50.6% on summer weekends. In turn, the improvement in sales forecast accuracy has a measurable impact on logistics and warehousing operations. We quantify the value of incorporating weather forecasts in the planning process for the order fulfillment center workforce and show how their incorporation can be leveraged to reduce costs and increase performance. With a perfect information planning scenario, excess costs can be reduced by 11.6% compared with the cost reduction attainable with a baseline model that ignores weather information in workforce planning.

The significance of green factors such as uncertainty of return rates in supply networks has been extensively acknowledged in presented studies. A revenue sharing contract improves the performance of green supply chain and has a significant role in the profitability of total supply chain. There are few quantitative studies on revenue sharing contract in green supply chains. In this study, we propose coordination subject matters of a green supply chain with recycling perishable goods, involving suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, together with collection and disposal centers, in a multi-product, multi-period and multi-level basis under Fuzzy conditions. The consequences indicate that in dairy industries, appropriate collected returned products could be used as raw material for another product, which increases the supply chain profits and reduces waste, and also, since perishable goods have a limited shelf life, they can be reusable if they are collected before reaching to a critical time. Furthermore, the proposed revenue sharing contract can share benefits between supply network members and gain coordination of channel.

This queue is characterized by Poisson arrivals at rate λ, exponential service times at rate μ, n service agents and generally distributed patience times of customers. The model is applied in the call center environment, as it captures the tradeoff between operational efficiency (staffing cost) and service quality (accessibility of agents). In our research, three asymptotic operational regimes for medium to large call centers are studied. These regimes correspond to the following three staffing rules, as λ and n increase indefinitely and μ held fixed: Efficiency-Driven (ED): n\ \approx \ (\lambda / \mu)\cdot (1 - \gamma),\gamma > 0, Quality-Driven (QD): n \ \approx \ ( \lambda / \mu)\cdot (1 + \gamma),\gamma > 0 , and Quality and Efficiency Driven (QED): n \ \approx \ \lambda/ \mu+\beta \sqrt{\lambda/\mu},-\infty < \beta < \infty . In the ED regime, the probability to abandon and average wait converge to constants. In the QD regime, we observe a very high service level at the cost of possible overstaffing. Finally, the QED regime carefully balances quality and efficiency: agents are highly utilized, but the probability to abandon and the average wait are small (converge to zero at rate 1/\sqrt{n} ). Numerical experiments demonstrate that, for a wide set of system parameters, the QED formulae provide excellent approximation for exact M/M/n + G performance measures. The much simpler ED approximations are still very useful for overloaded queueing systems. Finally, empirical findings have demonstrated a robust linear relation between the fraction abandoning and average wait. We validate this relation, asymptotically, in the QED and QD regimes.

In this system, customers of the P highest priorities (P<K) can preempt customers with lower priorities, ejecting them from service and sending them back into the queue. Service times are assumed exponential with the same mean for all classes. The Laplace–Stieltjes transforms of waiting times are calculated explicitly and the Laplace–Stieltjes transforms of sojourn times are provided in an implicit form via a system of functional equations. In both cases, moments of any order can be easily calculated. Specifically, we provide formulae for the steady state means and the second moments of waiting times for all priority classes. We also study some approximations of sojourn-time distributions via their moments. In a practical part of our paper, we discuss the use of mixed priorities for different types of Service Level Agreements, including an example based on a real scheduling problem of IT support teams.
Seung Bum Soh, Itai Gurvich;2016;https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2016.1532;Call Center Staffing: Service-Level Constraints and Index Priorities;Operations Research;https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1532;12;pubsonline;gurvich_et_al_2008;True;0030-364X;A+;Abstract Call centers attribute different values to different customer segments. These values are reflected in quality-of-service targets. The prevalent target service factor (TSF) formulation requires, for example, that 80% of VIP customers wait less than 20 seconds while setting the target to 30 seconds for non-VIP customers. The call center must determine the staffing level together with a prioritization rule that meets these targets at minimal cost. In practice, because of the underlying complexity of these systems, the prioritization rule is often selected in a heuristic manner rather than being systematically optimized. When considering the universe of prioritization policies, index rules provide a customizable and easy to define heuristic and for this reason are implemented in various call center software packages. We use the TSF formulation as a stepping stone toward a better understanding of index rules. We first construct an asymptotically optimal solution for the TSF problem. The prioritization component of our solution is a tracking policy rather than an index rule. We prove that despite index rules’ significant flexibility, no instance of these prioritization rules is optimal for the TSF problem. The suboptimality of index rules follows from an essential characteristic of these: restricting attention to index rules (as is heuristically done in practice) is asymptotically equivalent to requiring that a VIP customer always waits less than a regular (non-VIP) customer who arrives at the same time. This, in particular, implies that the use of index rules in practice can be rationalized if (and only if) the manager requires such strong differentiation.

Accordingly, the operational scale of call centers has been expanding, and it is now important to manage operators efficiently so as to contain the cost increase. For this purpose, one of the key challenges is how to estimate the population size of potential customers who may access call centers, since it dictates the number of operators to be prepared. The purpose of this paper is to develop and analyze a Markov chain model so as to achieve this goal.

In this model, medical assistants (MAs) take a more central role in patient care and population health management. MAs’ traditionally low status may give them a unique view on changing organizational dynamics and teamwork. However, little empirical work exists on how team-based organizational designs affect the experiences of low-status health care workers like MAs. Purposes:  The aim of this study was to describe how team-based primary care affects the experiences of MAs. A secondary aim was to explore variation in these experiences. Methodology/Approach:  In late 2014, the authors interviewed 30 MAs from nine primary care practices transitioning to team-based care. Interviews addressed job responsibilities, teamwork, implementation, job satisfaction, and learning. Data were analyzed using a thematic networks approach. Interviews also included closed-ended questions about workload and job satisfaction. Results:  Most MAs reported both a higher workload (73%) and a greater job satisfaction (86%) under team-based primary care. Interview data surfaced four mechanisms for these results, which suggested more fulfilling work and greater respect for the MA role: (a) relationships with colleagues, (b) involvement with patients, (c) sense of control, and (d) sense of efficacy. Facilitators and barriers to these positive changes also emerged. Conclusion:  Team-based care can provide low-status health care workers with more fulfilling work and strengthen relationships across status lines. The extent of this positive impact may depend on supporting factors at the organization, team, and individual worker levels. Practice Implications:  To maximize the benefits of team-based care, primary care leaders should recognize the larger role that MAs play under this model and support them as increasingly valuable team members. Contingent on organizational conditions, practices may find MAs who are willing to manage the increased workload that often accompanies team-based care.

This research examines how training influences a salesperson’s ability to manage such a technological change in the firm’s sales strategy. Findings suggest that formality of training has a positive effect and voluntariness has a negative effect on the perceived effectiveness of training in a change implementation context. Older salespeople and those likely to be favorably affected by the change respond more positively to timely training and a less formal training format. Training effectiveness in turn has a positive influence on the salesperson’s perceived ability to manage the change, with learning orientation of the salesperson weakening the effect. Implications for the design of sales force automation and change implementation training programs are discussed.

The approach takes into account the stochastic nature of the objective and constraint performance measures, and allows the customer demands to occur with a random size and all events to occur at random points in time (including the stochastic lead times). Experimental studies are performed to evaluate the efficiency of the developed algorithms and other existing solution approaches.

A dedicated team is assigned to address all (and only those) requirements that are specific to the customer. However, this way of organizing service delivery leads to inefficiencies due to inability to use expertise and available resources across teams in a flexible manner. To address some of these challenges, in recent times, there has been interest in shared delivery of services, where instead of having customer specific teams working in silos, there are cross-customer teams (shared resource pools) that can potentially service more than one customer. However, this gives rise to the question of what is the best way of grouping the shared resources across customer? Especially, with the large variations in the technical and domain skills required to address customer requirements, what should be the service delivery model for diverse customer workloads? Should it be customer-focused? Business domain focused? Or Technology focused? This paper simulates different delivery models in face of complex customer workload, diverse customer profiles, stringent service contracts, and evolving skills, with the goal of scientifically deriving principles of decision making for a suitable delivery model. Results show that workload arrival pattern, customer work profile combinations and domain skills, all play a significant role in the choice of delivery model. Specifically, the complementary nature of work arrivals and degree of overlapping skill requirements among customers play a crucial role in the choice of models. Interestingly, the impact of skill expertise level of resources is overshadowed by these two factors.

The call center handles inbound calls, as well as some alternative back-office jobs. The call arrival process is assumed to follow a doubly non-stationary stochastic process with a random mean arrival rate. The inbound calls have to be handled as quickly as possible, while the back-office jobs, such as answering emails, may be delayed to some extent. The staffing problem is modeled as a generalized newsboy-type model under an expected cost criterion. Two different solution approaches are considered. First, by discretization of the underlying probability distribution, we explicitly formulate the expected cost newsboy-type formulation as a stochastic program. Second, we develop a robust programming formulation. The characteristics of the two methods and the associated optimal solutions are illustrated through a numerical study based on real-life data. In particular we focus on the numerical tractability of each formulation. We also show that the alternative workload of back-office jobs offers an interesting flexibility allowing to decrease the total operating cost of the call center.

In reality, besides the fresh calls (initial call attempts), there are many redials (re-attempts after abandonments) and reconnects (re-attempts after answered calls) in call centers. Neglecting redials and reconnects will inevitably lead to inaccurate forecasts, which eventually leads to inaccurate staffing decisions. However, most of the call center data sets do not have customer-identity information, which makes it difficult to identify how many calls are fresh. Motivated by this, the goal of this paper is to estimate the number of fresh calls, and the redial and reconnect probabilities. To this end, we propose a model to estimate these three variables. We formulate our estimation model as a minimization problem, where the actual redial and reconnect probabilities lead to the minimum objective value. We validate our estimation results via real call center data and simulated data.

We first develop a simulation model for a call center with multi-skill agents and multi-class customers to sample quality of service (QoS) outcomes as measured by service level (SL). We then train a machine learning algorithm on a small number of simulation samples to quickly produce a look-up table of QoS for all candidate schedules. The machine learning algorithm is agnostic to the simulation and only uses information from the staff schedules. This allows our method to generalize across different real-life conditions and scenarios. Through two numerical examples using real-life call center scenarios we show that our method works surprisingly well, with out-of-sample fit (R-squared) of over 0.95 when comparing the machine learning prediction of SL to that of the ground truth from the simulation.

In this paper, we first build a high fidelity simulation model at a weekly level to evaluate various Quality of Service (QoS) measurements for a given schedule. Then we propose a simulation-based optimization algorithm to solve the staffing and shift scheduling problem integrally to minimize the total costs of agents under certain QoS requirements. In the numerical experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with realistic instances.

When a disease spreads rapidly in a short period of time in a specific area, it is called an epidemic outbreak. An outbreak might start in a single community or spread across multiple countries. It might last anywhere from a few days to several years. PHO (Public health organizations) are taking preventative efforts to stop the disease from spreading besides that they are highly benefited from accurate prediction of infectious disease. The emergence of big data in the sectors of health and biomedicine, precise data analysis aids early disease identification and better patient treatment. It is now increasingly viable to use massive computing power to predict and manage outbreaks. Our goal is to investigate and determine how outbreaks spread in villages and suburbs where medical care may be limited. A machine learning model is required to forecast epidemic dynamics and identify where the next outbreak is most likely to occur. Because these are important features that contribute subtly to the dynamics of the disease epidemic, our method considers the climate, geography, and distribution of population in impacted region. Our approach will assist health authorities in taking the necessary steps to guarantee that there are sufficient resources to fulfil demand and, if feasible, to prevent epidemics from arising.

In this paper, we leverage the collected big data from customers' activities at a firm's online account to estimate the likelihood that an individual customer will phone the firm's contact centers within the next thirty days. Our predictive modeling approach has two distinguished characteristics: (i) predicting calls at an individual customer level, and (ii) incorporating the big data from online account activities, in addition to the customer's past telephone queries. The individual-level data used in this study is from contact centers of a major U. S. insurance firm. Various classes of features specifying the customer segment, recency and frequency of customer interactions are considered. Different neural network architectures are investigated to achieve the best prediction accuracy. Out-of-sample performance analyses evince the capability of the developed model to accurately predict future policyholders' calls at both the individual and aggregate levels.

ICUs currently lack systematic admission criteria, largely because the impact of ICU admission on patient outcomes has not been well quantified. This makes evaluating the performance of candidate admission strategies difficult. Using a large patient-level data set of more than 190,000 hospitalizations across 15 hospitals, we first quantify the cost of denied ICU admission for a number of patient outcomes. We use hospital operational factors as instrumental variables to handle the endogeneity of the admission decisions and identify important specification issues that are required for this approach to be valid. Using the quantified cost estimates, we then provide a simulation framework for evaluating various admission strategies' performance. By simulating a hospital with 21 ICU beds, we find that we could save about $1.9 million per year by using an optimal policy based on observables designed to reduce readmissions and hospital length of stay. We also discuss the role of unobserved patient factors, which physicians may discretionarily account for when making admission decisions, and show that including these unobservables could result in a more than threefold increase in benefits compared to just optimizing the policy over the observable patient factors.

In addition, we assume that application requests are heterogeneous with different workload distributions and resource requirements and the arrival, rates of request are time-varying. Managing such a heterogeneous, transient, and non-stationary system is a tremendous challenge. We take an unconventional approach, in that we force the queue lengths in each powered-on server to be time-stable (i.e., stationary). It allows the operators to guarantee performance and effectively monitor the system. We formulate a mixed-integer program to minimize energy costs while satisfying time-stability. Simulation results show that our suggested approach can stabilize queue length distributions and provide probabilistic performance guarantees on waiting times.

We assume that the underlying environment is such that at all times the load from each class is very high and a large number of servers are necessary which, for example, is fairly common in many data centers. In addition, each server can host one or more classes. Design, control and performance analysis under such heterogeneous and transient conditions is extremely difficult. To address this shortcoming we have suggested a holistic approach that includes a combination of sizing, assignment, and routing in an integrated fashion. Our proposed approach decomposes a multi-dimensional and non-stationary problem into a one-dimensional, simpler and stationary one, and achieves time-stability by introducing an insignificant number of dummy requests. Based on time-stability, our suggested approach can provide performance bounds and guarantees for time-varying and transient system. Moreover, we can operate the data centers in an energy-efficient manner via suggested approach.

The focus is on systems in which multiple agent classes with different qualifications serve multiple customer classes with different needs. We assume that customers are impatient, abandon if they have to wait, and that they may retry. A discrete-time modeling approach is used to capture the dynamics of the system due to time-dependent arrival rates. Staffing levels and shift schedules are simultaneously optimized over a set of different approximate realizations of the underlying stochastic processes to consider the randomness of the system. The numerical results indicate that the presented approach works best for medium-sized and large contact centers with skills-based routing of customers for which stochastic queueing models are rarely applicable.

After accounting for endogeneity issues, we investigate the relationship between governance and performances (both in terms of cost saving and service quality) on a sample of 132 initiatives from the 2009 Offshoring Research Network survey. Our results show that the alignment of the governance choice with an extended transaction cost economics approach leads to better performances. However, the impact of a possible misalignment: (1) is asymmetric, as only the failure to undertake a captive mode negatively affects performance, and (2) negatively affects service quality more than cost saving.

Increasing commoditization of business services and growing client experience with outsourcing have created a range of competitive service delivery options for client firms. Yet, data from the Offshoring Research Network (ORN) suggests that, despite increasing market options and growing client expectations related to service quality and cost efficiency, clients typically renew provider contracts and develop longer-term relationships with providers. Based on ORN data, this paper explores drivers of this phenomenon. The findings suggest that providers promote contract renewal by making client specific investments in software, IT infrastructure and training, and by involving clients in outsourcing operations, thereby increasing relation specific joint equity and creating opportunities for client monitoring and control. Interestingly, these strategies apply to routine rather than knowledge-intensive tasks, and are more likely to be applied by large rather than small providers. Surprisingly, high degree of contract specification makes contract renewal less likely. The paper contributes to the growing literature on strategic outsourcing of business services and the importance of governance mechanisms addressing “hidden costs” as well as “hidden benefits” of offshore outsourcing relationships.

Using empirical data collected from three active EDs, we develop an analytic model to provide an effective staffing plan for EDs. Patient demand is aggregated into discrete time buckets and used to model the stochastic distribution of patient demand within these buckets, which considerably improves model tractability. This model is capable of scheduling providers with different skill profiles who work either individually or in teams, and with patients of varying acuity levels. We show how our model helps to balance staffing costs and patient service levels, and how it facilitates examination of important ED staffing policies.

Current simulation tools allow demand modeling using known closed-form statistical distributions or raw demand data collected from operations. In many instances, demand data cannot be described by known closed-form statistical distributions and the raw data collected from operations is not representative of future demand. This paper describes an approach to demand modeling where historical demand data collected over a finite time period is combined with user-input using two-tier bootstrapping to produce synthetic demand data that preserves the statistical distribution of the original data but has overall metrics such as volume, workflow mix and individual task and job sizes that represent projected future state scenarios. When the customer demand data follows highly non-normal distributions, a modified procedure is presented.

ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES IN IS;no doi;8;aisel;bhandari_et_al_2008;False;unknown;k.R.;"Abstract The importance of Information Technology (IT) is growing, and in a hypercompetitive market IT must be used as a strategic asset for companies to succeed. In order to gain strategic benefits from IT, companies need to be innovative when deploying IT. This can be achieved by reengineering business processes to take advantage of the possibilities IT provides. In 1993 Thomas H. Davenport presented a framework describing ""the role of IT in process innovation"". Based on this framework, the purpose of this paper is to conduct a literature review to answer the following research question: ""What kind of opportunities does IT provide for process innovation?"". Davenport's framework is used as an analytical lens to review articles from the top 20 IS and management journals. The paper provides an overview and an in-depth analysis of the literature on IT-enabled process innovation and suggests avenues for future research as well as recommendations for practitioners. Our analyses reveal five distinct themes related to opportunities for IT-enabled process innovation, all of which offer guidance to practitioners and highlight gaps in our current knowledge about how to leverage IT for innovation purposes."

A Gaussian copula is used to capture the dependence among non-normal distributions. Using a centralized call center reduces costs by approximately 75% compared to having individual call centers at each cooperative. Adding cooperatives to the centralized call center is projected to further decrease costs per member. An out-of-sample forecasting exercise after the call center expanded validated the model's forecast that additional cooperatives could be added without a proportional increase in the peak number of calls.

A numerical experiment was presented to testify the performance of the model. An objective analysis of the model was made in the end.

This thesis develops a PCA-BP model to forecast future call volumes of half-hour periods. the approach adopted firstly uses principle component analysis to eliminate the intraday correlations between the call volumes of 48 consecutive half-hour periods and to simplify the structure of BP neural network by dimension reduction. the processed data are then input into BP network for training. We use the trained network to forecast future call volumes and apply a competing model to the same data. It turns out that the new model performs better and can be adapted in call center traffic forecasting. to the best of our knowledge, the forecasting method we built has not been used in this area hitherto and it deserves trial application accordingly.

This emerging business-to-business context motivates us to study a new form of supply chain coordination problem. We consider a staffing platform managing an on-demand workforce to serve multiple firms facing stochastic labor demand. Before demand realization, each individual firm can hire permanent employees, whereas the platform determines a compensation rate for potential on-demand workers. After knowing the realized demand, firms in need can request on-demand workers from the platform, and then, the platform operator allocates the available on-demand workforce among the firms. We explore how to maximize and distribute the benefits of an on-demand workforce through coordinating self-interested parties in the staffing system. Methodology/results: We combine game theory and online optimization techniques to address the challenges in incentivizing and coordinating the online workforce. We propose a novel and easily implementable fill rate-based allocation and coordination mechanism that enables the on-demand workforce to be shared optimally when individual firms and the platform operator make decisions in their own interest. We also show that the proposed mechanism can be adapted to the cases when contract terms need to be identical to all firms and when actual demand is unverifiable. Managerial implications: The proposed contract mechanism is in line with the performance-based contracting commonly used in on-demand staffing services. Our results suggest that under an appropriately designed performance-based mechanism, individual firms and the platform operator can share the maximum benefits of on-demand staffing.

In doing so, we model the system rates using gamma distributions that create randomness in operating characteristics used in the optimization formulation. We divide the day into discrete time intervals where a simulation based stochastic programming method is used to determine staffing levels. More specifically, we develop a model to select the optimal number of agents required for a given time interval by minimizing an expected cost function, which consists of agent and abandonment (opportunity) costs, while considering the service quality requirements such as the delay probability. The objective function as well as the constraints in our formulation are random variables. The novelty of our approach is to introduce a solution method for the staffing of an operation where all three system rates (arrival, service, and abandonment) are random variables. We illustrate the use of the proposed model using both real and simulated call center data. In addition, we provide solution comparisons across different formulations, consider a dynamic extension, and discuss sensitivity implications of changing constraint upper bounds as well as prior hyper-parameters. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the dynamic environment of multi-channel customer contact, organizational decision-makers often rely on robust but simplistic forecasting methods. Although forecasting literature indicates that incorporating additional information into time series predictions adds value by improving model performance, extant research in the call center domain barely considers the potential of sophisticated multivariate models. Hence, with an extended dynamic harmonic regression (DHR) approach, this study proposes a new reliable method for call center arrivals’ forecasting that is able to capture the dynamics of a time series and to include contextual information in form of predictor variables. The study evaluates the predictive potential of the approach on the call and e-mail arrival series of a leading German online retailer comprising 174 weeks of data. The analysis involves time series cross-validation with an expanding rolling window over 52 weeks and comprises established time series as well as machine learning models as benchmarks. The multivariate DHR model outperforms the compared models with regard to forecast accuracy for a broad spectrum of lead times. This study further gives contextual insights into the selection and optimal implementation of marketing-relevant predictor variables such as catalog releases, mail as well as postal reminders, or billing cycles.

Thus, in this regard, methodological improvements are drivers for a company’s success within its competitive environment. Therefore, this research investigates the predictive impact of both lead times and model selection on accuracy. We analyze 174.5 weeks of data from an online retailer’s call center comprising customer support’s call and e-mail arrivals. We compare traditional as well as novel time series and machine learning (ML) models for ten different lead times with cross-validation and a rolling forecast origin. Our findings indicate that accuracy decreases with increasing lead time. Specifically, we prove that the models’ forecast types are impacted differently by lead times: For all lead time extents, regression and ML approaches maintain their accuracy levels with ex-post forecasts. In contrast, time series models’ ex-ante forecasts worsen the longer the lead time, i.e., the further the time series’ values used for prediction lie in the past. Overall, random forest (RF) outperforms the remaining models for almost all considered lead time constellations.

This rapid scheduling process is designed to support front line managers who wish to evaluate multiple scheduling options in a what if analysis mode.

This paper is motivated by work with a provider of outsourced technical support services in which most projects (client specific support operations) include an inbound tier one help desk subject to a monthly service level agreement (SLA). Support services are highly specialized and a significant training investment is required, an investment that is not transferable to other projects. We investigate the option of cross training a subset of agents so that they may serve calls from two separate projects, a process we refer to as partial pooling. Our paper seeks to quantity the benefits of partial pooling and characterize the conditions under which pooling is most beneficial. We find that low levels of cross training yield significant benefit.

We study a sample average approximation (SAA) approach that uses nested sampling, in which at each stage, a number of scenarios are examined and a number of simulation replications are performed for each scenario to estimate the next-stage constraints. This approach provides an approximate solution to the multistage problem. To establish the consistency of the SAA approach, we first consider a two-stage problem and show that in the second-stage problem, given a scenario, the optimal values and solutions of the SAA converge to those of the true problem with probability one when the sample sizes go to infinity. These convergence results do not hold uniformly over all possible scenarios for the second stage problem. We are nevertheless able to prove that the optimal values and solutions of the SAA converge to the true ones with probability one when the sample sizes at both stages increase to infinity. We also prove exponential convergence of the probability of a large deviation for the optimal value of the SAA, the true value of an optimal solution of the SAA, and the probability that any optimal solution to the SAA is an optimal solution of the true problem. All of these results can be extended to a multistage setting and we explain how to do it. Our framework and SAA results cover a large variety of resource allocation problems for which at each stage after the first one, new information becomes available and the allocation can be readjusted, under constraints that involve expectations estimated by Monte Carlo. As an illustration, we apply this SAA method to a staffing problem in a call center, in which the goal is to optimize the numbers of agents of each type under some constraints on the quality of service (QoS). The staffing allocation has to be decided under an uncertain arrival rate with a prior distribution in the first stage, and can be adjusted at some additional cost when better information on the arrival rate becomes available in later stages.

In this paper we propose a new way to approximate the QoS functions by logistic functions and design a new algorithm that combines logistic regression, cut generations and logistic-based local search to efficiently find good staffing solutions. We report computational results using examples up to 65 call types and 89 agent groups showing that our approach performs well in practice, in terms of solution quality and computing time.

The outsourcer does not have perfect information about the service provider’s capacity cost (i.e., cost of providing fast service) and quality cost (i.e., cost of achieving a high quality level). Moreover, the two unknown costs may be positively, or negatively, correlated with each other. We solve for the outsourcer’s optimal outsourcing contract, and show that the structure of the optimal contract depends on the relationship between the costs. Specifically, we highlight the following observations when the two costs are negatively correlated: First, under certain conditions, the outsourcer may be able to squeeze the supplier’s profit (information rent) to zero for an intermediate range of cost realizations, second, it is possible that the service supply chain is coordinated by using the outsourcer’s optimal contract. We then examine the performance of two classes of commonly observed contracts that are relatively simple to implement. It has been found that these simple contracts generally perform well when the costs are positively correlated, but they could perform much worse when the costs are negatively correlated. Our results therefore caution outsourcing companies that the potential trade-off between capacity cost and quality cost may require a careful design of outsourcing contracts.

In this problem, the admission decision is made by each server who is assigned dedicated capacity. However, a server can borrow capacity from other servers if his dedicated capacity is exhausted. The borrower compensates the lender by a payment equal to the “borrowing cost.” Hence, the servers share their capacities via borrowing, but they also compete against each other for their pooled capacities. We formulate this problem as a stochastic dynamic game and characterize the equilibrium strategic admission behavior of servers. We show that the critical factors that affect the equilibrium behavior and the system revenue are the magnitude of the borrowing cost, the arrival rate of customers and the revenue difference between different classes of customers. We have identified conditions under which servers maximizing their own payoffs end up making decisions that benefit the system. Our study highlights the important roles that the borrowing cost plays in shaping servers’ behavior in service systems and provides concrete guidance for practitioners to design a decentralized admission control system.

We consider the effects of vertical and horizontal product differentiation on demand. In deriving the Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibria (SPNE), it is shown that either a symmetric outsourcing strategy (i.e., both manufacturers outsource) or an asymmetric sourcing strategy profile (i.e., manufacturers use different sourcing strategies) can be an SPNE. Insights are provided into how sourcing strategies are affected by the factors such as fixed setup cost, unit production cost, QI efficiency, and horizontal and vertical differentiations. It is found that larger horizontal differentiation expands the range over which symmetric outsourcing is an equilibrium. In addition, the outsourcing manufacturer may provide a higher QI level, produce a higher quantity, and offer a lower retail price than the insourcing one in the asymmetric sourcing setting. On the other hand, the insourcing manufacturer should pay more attention to the effect of the rival's sourcing strategy on the QI level than the outsourcing one. Finally, it is shown that all players have an incentive to determine sourcing partner relationships before the wholesale price contract is offered.

The objective is to find a minimal cost staffing solution while meeting a target level for the quality of service (QoS) to customers. We consider a staffing problem in which joint chance constraints are imposed on the QoS of the day. Our joint chance-constrained formulation is more rational capturing the correlation between different call types, as compared to separate chance-constrained versions considered in previous studies. We show that, in general, the probability functions in the joint-chance constraints display S-shaped curves, and the optimal solutions should belong to the concave regions of the curves. Thus, we propose an approach combining a heuristic phase to identify solutions lying in the concave part and a simulation-based cut generation phase to create outer-approximations of the probability functions. This allows us to find good staffing solutions satisfying the joint-chance constraints by simulation and linear programming. We test our formulation and algorithm using call center examples of up to 65 call types and 89 agent groups, which shows the benefits of our joint-chance constrained formulation and the advantage of our algorithm over standard ones.

However, the universal goal is to improve the quality of the workforce in order to strengthen the bottom line of the organization. If this is to happen, those who design and deliver the training material must take advantage of the ever-growing field of research and evidence-based principles and apply it to the analysis, design, delivery, evaluation, and transfer of training systems. This chapter outlines the relevant research on what constitutes an effective training system. It provides an updated review on the foundational science of training and to offer further guidance related to the design, delivery, and evaluation of training programs. The chapter discusses research on training facilitators/instructors, the importance of practice scenarios, and findings on the content and delivery of feedback.
Tingliang Huang,  Ying-Ju Chen;2014;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12298;Service Systems with Experience-Based Anecdotal Reasoning Customers;Production and Operations Management;https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12298;55;wiley;ren_zhou_et_al_2008;True;1059-1478;A;Abstract The existing queueing literature typically assumes that customers either perfectly know the expected waiting time or are able to form rational expectations about it. In contrast, in this article, we study canonical service models where customers do not have such full information or capability. We assume that customers lack full capability or ample opportunities to perfectly infer the service rate or estimate the expected waiting time, and thus can only rely on past experiences and anecdotal reasoning to make their joining decisions. We fully characterize the steady-state equilibrium in this service system. Compared with the fully rational benchmark, we find that customers with anecdotal reasoning are less price-sensitive. Consequently, with a higher market potential (higher arrival rate), a revenue-maximizing firm may increase the price if the service rate is exogenous, and it may decrease the price if the service rate is at the firm's discretion. Both results go against the commonly accepted pricing recommendations in the fully rational benchmark. We also show that revenue maximization and welfare maximization lead to fundamentally different pricing strategies with anecdotal reasoning, whereas they are equivalent in the fully rational benchmark.

However, to date very few multi-country studies exist that compare and contrast outsourcing decisions and practices by organisations in different countries. The present research aims to contribute to this area by reporting and analysing results from a survey conducted in 15 countries. Using a total dataset of 806 responses, empirical exploratory insights are reported on the evolving approaches and concepts of outsourcing decision-making in different countries. More specifically, this study provides characteristics of the most important suppliers to respondents across the 15 nations, and explores rationales for outsourcing, highlighting country-specific similarities and differences. In addition, using transaction cost economics (TCE), four hypotheses are developed and tested, linking contract specificity, purchase risk, supplier responsiveness, and procedural rigour to purchase performance within an outsourcing context. In addition, differences on these main variables across the 15 countries are explored. Insights for academia and practice are highlighted.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of simulation modeling applications and programming languages do not provide the means to properly model the corresponding input processes. In order to obtain valid models, there is a substantial need for tools capable of modeling autocorrelated input processes. Accordingly, this paper provides a review of available tools to fit and model these processes. In addition to a brief theoretical discussion of the approaches, we provide tool evaluation from a practitioners perspective. The assessment of the tools is based on their ability to model input processes that are either fitted to a trace or defined explicitly by their characteristics, i.e., the marginal distribution and autocorrelation coefficients. In our experiments we found that tools relying on autoregressive models performed the best.

In an N-system, there are two customer classes that are catered by servers in two pools. Servers in one of the pools are cross-trained and can serve customers from both classes, whereas all of the servers in the other pool can serve only one of the customer classes. A customer reneges from his queue if his waiting time in the queue exceeds his patience. Our objective is to minimize the total cost that includes a linear holding cost and a reneging cost. We prove that, when the service speed is pool dependent, but not class dependent, a cμ-type greedy policy is asymptotically optimal in many-server heavy traffic.

We find that waiters react nonlinearly to their coworkers’ ability. In particular, when coworkers’ overall sales ability is low, increasing this ability may prompt waiters to redouble both upselling and cross-selling efforts. When overall coworkers’ ability is high, however, further increasing their ability may trigger waiters to reduce sales efforts. Our empirical findings imply that, to maximize sales, managers should mix waiters with heterogeneous ability levels during the same shift. Through a counterfactual analysis, we find that considering the inverted U-shaped peer effects when optimizing current waiters’ schedules without changing their utilization may increase total sales by approximately 2.48% at no extra cost.

Tour scheduling identifies the number of agents assigned to specific start and end times over the course of the planning period. Rostering is the process of assigning individual agents to specific shift schedules. In this article, we develop a basic example based on a call center application. We discuss how the problem can be formulated and solved as an integer program. We then discuss how the problem can grow unwieldy as staffing flexibility increases and discuss approaches for dealing with that problem. Finally, we identify issues that arise in other, noncall center applications.

A telecommunication system typically consists of a huge number of base stations with diverse geographical locations across a country, which highly complicates maintenance operations. To allocate maintenance resource properly, it is important to have a good understanding on the failure pattern of these base stations. Statistical inference of recurrent failures of these base stations is challenging because of the large number of base stations and the spatial correlation of their failure processes. Based on eight-month failure data of telecommunication base stations in Harbin, China, we propose a customized nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) model for recurrent failure data from telecommunication systems. The model consists of two layers, where the temporal layer applies an NHPP with station-specific frailty for failures of each base station, and the spatial layer uses a multivariate lognormal distribution to characterize the correlation among the frailties. The Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm is applied to estimate parameters included in the proposed model. We demonstrate the proposed model using the Harbin telecommunication system example with 7725 base stations and 4615 failure records.

Therefore, it is important to estimate the expected workload properly. For this purpose, we analyzed whether a dispatch center can be considered as a call center. Current call center publications very often model call arrivals as a non-homogeneous Poisson process. This bases on the underlying assumption of the caller’s independent decision to call or not to call. In case of an emergency, however, there are often calls from more than one person reporting the same incident and thus, these calls are not independent. Therefore, this paper focuses on the dependency of calls in a fire and rescue dispatch center. We analyzed and evaluated several distributions in this setting. Results are illustrated using real-world data collected from a typical German dispatch center in Cottbus (“Leitstelle Lausitz”). We identified the Pólya distribution as being superior to the Poisson distribution in describing the call arrival rate and the Weibull distribution to be more suitable than the exponential distribution for interarrival times and service times. However, the commonly used distributions offer acceptable approximations. This is important for estimating a sufficient staffing level in practice using, e.g., the Erlang-C model.

Using data collected from 205 emerging market-based BPO service providers in India, we examine the antecedents and consequences of establishing governance control mechanisms in BPO service providers. Specifically, we examine how structural (use of contracts with the client), administrative (effective allocation and demarcation of responsibilities within the firm), and relational (collaboration and information sharing with the client) mechanisms drive the performance of a BPO service provider operating in an emerging market. We also examine how key task-related (task connectivity and task security) and client-related (end customer orientation and global control) antecedents influence the use of different governance control approaches in this environment. Our analysis finds that both task connectivity and task security significantly impact use of structural and administrative mechanisms, whereas end customer orientation is significantly associated with the strength of the relational mechanisms governing the emerging market-based BPO service provider and its client. Further global control significantly influences the strength of the structural mechanisms between the client and the BPO service provider. Finally, the three mechanisms have a complementary influence in driving the BPO service provider's performance.

In modern digital workplaces, agents have different skills associated with corresponding and variable task preferences. Some are inclined to give up part of their payment to avoid unfavorable matches, and the platform manager, in turn, gains extra freedom in allocating tasks by possibly charging servers for favorable assignments. Innovative marketplaces facilitate task discretion and seek novel and beneficial implementations in the platform design. This naturally leads to the problem of exploring and optimizing the task allocation process. We introduce an innovative mechanism for task assignment in the workplace and compare it to the traditional mechanism in which task routing is solely the platform’s decision. To improve the welfare of all users, agents are allowed some task discretion in exchange for a fee. In a multiserver system, a server may request flexibility and, considering the other agents’ behavior, choose the costly to the platform option, which may or may not be beneficial for the platform when the agents’ and the platform’s preferences are misaligned. We model different working environments and server preferences via different distributions and study how the agents’ preferences, task costs, and flexibility fee affect the equilibrium assignment. In every case, through pricing and offering flexibility, the platform can do at least as well as a scheme with no flexibility. An important conclusion is that pricing task discretion can often improve the agents’ welfare and the labor platform’s profit.

Working faster may result in greater output and less delay, but may result in lower quality and dissatisfied customers. In this work, we consider dynamic models in a monopoly setting to explore the optimal balance among the multiple dimensions of speed, price, and wait time. The impact of quality is captured via the market demand potential, which is a function of the speed (quality) in the previous period. We obtain several results and insights. First, in scenarios where speed may be difficult to change over time (e.g., some automated production lines) but price can be changed, we show that the optimal price charged is such that the demand rate remains constant over time, even though the price and market potential are changing. Furthermore, we identify conditions when the firm will work at a speed that is higher or lower than a benchmark speed and characterize the behavior of prices over time. Second, in scenarios where a firm may not be able to change prices but can adjust the speed each period, the firm starts at a speed that may be faster or slower than a benchmark speed but converges to it over time. In this constant price case, as the benchmark speed increases, the initial speed adopted by the firm is actually lower but increases more quickly thereafter. We also characterize the behavior of price and speed in settings where both can be changed over time. Interestingly, a firm typically starts at a slow speed and increases the speed, price, and demand over time. Although our main model assumes that the firm internalizes the congestion cost, several of our results extend to a scenario where the demand rate is impacted by the congestion level.

After schedules are created, call center resource managers receive additional information that can affect forecasted workload and resource availability. In particular, there is significant evidence, both among practitioners and in the research literature, suggesting that actual call arrival volumes early in a scheduling period (typically an individual day or week) can provide valuable information about the call arrival pattern later in the same scheduling period. In this paper, we develop a flexible and powerful heuristic framework for managers to make intra-day resource adjustment decisions that take into account updated call forecasts, updated agent requirements, existing agent schedules, agents' schedule flexibility, and associated incremental labor costs. We demonstrate the value of this methodology in managing the trade-off between labor costs and service levels to best meet variable rates of demand for service, using data from an actual call center.

In this paper, we explore strategies for determining which calls should be handled by which agents, where these assignments are dynamically determined based on the specific attributes of the agents and/or the current state of the system. We test several routing strategies using data obtained from a medium-sized financial service firm's customer service call centers and present empirical performance results. These results allow us to characterize overall performance in terms of customer waiting time and overall resolution rate, identifying an efficient frontier of routing rules for this contact center.

Unfortunately, managers often struggle to provide consistent care, primarily due to last-minute nurse aide absences and choosing to staff these absences with aides from an external rental agency. We are the first to study the use of an “on-call” pool—aides on staff who may be called in to work in the event of absences—as an operational strategy to improve consistency. We provide structural results for the relationship between the number of aides in the on-call pool, staffing cost, and inconsistency level. We also show that a “restricted” on-call pool—in which the slots in the pool are distributed as evenly as possible across units—outperforms an “open,” or unrestricted, on-call pool. We further demonstrate that converting full-time positions to part-time positions can improve consistency of care if the part-time aides’ on-call pool participation rate is sufficiently high. Numerical results for a typical 100-bed and a 200-bed facility demonstrate that an on-call pool can (a) reduce the staffing costs due to absences by 24% while also (slightly) reducing the inconsistency level, or (b) significantly reduce the inconsistency level without increasing costs.

This creates two important questions for service design. First, how important is it to maintain the continuity of service for individuals? Second, because maintaining continuity is costly and, at times, operationally impractical for both the organization (because of potentially lower utilization) and providers (because of high effort required), should certain customer types, such as those with complex needs, be prioritized for continuity? These questions are particularly important in healthcare services where patients with chronic conditions visit primary care offices repeatedly. Therefore, we explore these questions in the context of diabetes, a chronic disease. Academic/practical relevance: Although the operations management (OM) and healthcare literatures suggest that higher continuity is better for health outcomes, the possibility that one could have too much continuity has not been explored. We draw on literature on continuity of care from the healthcare literature and learning effects from the OM literature to theorize and then show a curvilinear relationship. In addition, we further the literature on continuity by examining different categories for prioritization. Methodology: We use a detailed and comprehensive data set from the Veterans Health Administration, the largest integrated healthcare delivery system in the United States, which permits us to control for potential sources of heterogeneity. We analyze over 300,000 patients over an 11-year period who suffer from diabetes, a chronic disease whose successful management requires continuity of care, as well as kidney disease, a major complication of diabetes. We use an empirical approach to quantify the relationship between continuity of care and three important health outcomes: inpatient visits, length of stay, and readmission rate. We conduct extensive robustness checks and sensitivity analyses to validate our findings. Results: We find that continuity of care is related to improvements in all three health outcomes. Moreover, we find that the gains are not linearly improving in continuity, but rather the relationship is curvilinear, whereby outcomes improve and then decline in increasing continuity of care, suggesting that there may be value in having multiple providers. Additionally, we find that continuity of care is even more important for patients suffering from more complex conditions. Managerial implications: Identifying the amount of continuity of care to provide and determining which individuals to prioritize are both of interest to practitioners and policymakers because they can help in designing appropriate policies for staffing and work allocation.

Customers benefit from having an additional means of product support, while firms benefit by lowering the costs of supporting a large customer base. Typically these forums are populated with content generated by users, consisting of questioners (solution seekers) and solvers (solution providers). While questioners can be expected to keep returning as long as they can find answers, firms must employ different means in order to recognize and encourage the contributions of solvers. We identify and compare the impact of two widely adopted recognition mechanisms on the philanthropic behavior of solvers. In the first mechanism, feedback-based recognition, solver contribution is evaluated by questioners. In the second mechanism, quantity-based recognition, all contributions are weighted equally regardless of questioner feedback. We draw on the pro-social behavior literature to identify four drivers of solver contribution: (1) peer recognition, (2) image motivation, (3) social comparison, and (4) social exposure. We show that the choice of recognition mechanism strongly influences a solver’s problem-solving behavior, highlighting the importance of the firm’s decision in this regard. We address issues of solvers self-selecting a type of recognition mechanism by using propensity score analysis in order to show that solver behavior is a result of forum conditioning. We also study the impact of the recognition mechanism on forum quality and the effectiveness of support to draw comparative analytics.

The arrival rate and the proportion of servers present are treated as random variables. The basic model is a multi-server queue with customer abandonment, allowing non-exponential service-time and time-to-abandon distributions. The goal is to maximize the expected net return, given throughput benefit and server, customer-abandonment and customer-waiting costs, but attention is also given to the standard deviation of the return. The approach is to approximate the performance and the net return, conditional on the random model-parameter vector, and then uncondition to get the desired results. Two recently-developed approximations are used for the conditional performance measures: first, a deterministic fluid approximation and, second, a numerical algorithm based on a purely Markovian birth-and-death model, having state-dependent death rates.

We study the rate-matching control, where the service rate is made proportional to the arrival rate. We show that the model with the rate-matching control can be regarded as a deterministic time transformation of a stationary G / G / 1 model, so that the queue length distribution is stabilized as time evolves. However, the time-varying virtual waiting time is not stabilized. We show that the time-varying expected virtual waiting time with the rate-matching service-rate control becomes inversely proportional to the arrival rate in a heavy-traffic limit. We also show that no control that stabilizes the queue length asymptotically in heavy traffic can also stabilize the virtual waiting time. Then we consider two square-root service-rate controls and show that one of these stabilizes the waiting time when the arrival rate changes slowly relative to the average service time, so that a pointwise stationary approximation is appropriate.

Because the blocking probabilities necessarily change dramatically after each staffing change, we randomize the time of each staffing change about the planned time. We apply simulation to show that (i) the blocking probabilities cannot be stabilized without some form of randomization, (ii) the new staffing algorithm with randomiation can stabilize blocking probabilities at target levels and (iii) the required staffing can be quite different when the Poisson assumption is dropped. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Currently, mobile network access is provided by a relatively small number of service providers, in part due to the high costs of operating wireless network systems and the accompanying ""backbone"" architectures. Mobile users have to establish proprietary billing arrangements with their service providers, and are limited to using the wireless networks run by their service provider. The existence of the Internet as the baseline network backbone with its unifying TCP/IP architecture, and the advances in low cost wireless network technology allows for a new means of wireless network access for mobile users. Small scale service providers can simply install low cost wireless network base stations and plug them into the Internet, providing network access to any willing mobile user. The low barriers to entry makes it likely that there will be a large number of service providers. A non-proprietary billing protocol used among these service providers will allow mobile users to use any service provider's network. This leads to better wireless coverage for the mobile user. The authors propose one such protocol. This protocol may be implemented as an extension to the Mobile IP protocol, as they share certain similarities in their execution. This would spur its deployment as Mobile IP is an open standard that will likely be used by mobile users."

To meet the rising expectation of high-quality services, efficiently allocating resources is vital for service systems to balance service qualities with costs. In particular, this paper focuses on a class of resource allocation problems where the service-level objective and constraints are in the form of probabilistic measures. Further, process complexity and system dynamics in service systems often render their performance evaluation and optimization challenging and relying on simulation models. To this end, we propose a generalized resource allocation model with probabilistic measures, and subsequently, develop an optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) formulation to select the optimal solution subject to random noises in simulation. The OCBA formulation minimizes the expected opportunity cost that penalizes based on the quality of the selected solution. Further, the formulation takes a Bayesian approach to consider the prior knowledge and potential performance correlations on candidate solutions. Then, the asymptotic optimality conditions of the formulation are derived, and an iterative algorithm is developed accordingly. Numerical experiments and a case study inspired by a real-world problem in a hospital emergency department demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for solving the resource allocation problem via simulation.

Scaling the arrival rates and number of servers arises naturally when a manager updates a staffing schedule in response to a forecast of increased customer demand. Mathematically, this type of scaling ultimately gives us the fluid and diffusion limits as found in Mandelbaum et al. (Queueing Syst 30(1):149–201, 1998) for Markovian service networks. These asymptotics were inspired by the Halfin and Whitt (Oper Res 29(3):567–588, 1981) scaling for multi-server queues. In this paper, we provide a review and an in-depth analysis of the Erlang-A queueing model. We prove new results about cumulant moments of the Erlang-A queue, the transient behavior of the Erlang-A limit cycle, new fluid limits for the delay time of a virtual customer, and optimal static staffing policies for healthcare systems. We combine tools from queueing theory, ordinary differential equations, complex analysis, cumulant moments, orthogonal polynomials, and dynamic optimization to obtain new insights about this fundamental queueing model.

We introduce new weight-based routing policies where each pair (call type, agent group) is given a matching priority defined as an affine combination of the longest waiting time for that call type and the longest idle time or the number of idle agents in that agent group. The coefficients in this combination are parameters to be optimized. This type of policy is more flexible than traditional ones found in practice, and it performs better in many situations. We consider objective functions that account for the service levels, the abandonment ratios, and the fairness of occupancy across agent groups. We select the parameters of all considered policies via simulation-based optimization heuristics. This requires only the availability of a simulation model of the call center, which can be much more detailed and realistic than the models used elsewhere in the literature to study the optimality of certain types of routing rules. We offer a first numerical study of realistic routing rules that takes into account the complexity of real-life call centers.

The objective is to minimize the total cost of agents under some chance constraints, defined over the randomness of the service level in a given time period. In the first stage, an initial staffing must be determined in advance based on imperfect forecast of the arrival rates. At a later time, when the forecast becomes more accurate, this staffing can be corrected with recourse actions, by adding or removing agents at the price of some penalty costs. We present a method that combines simulation, mixed integer programming, and cut generation to solve this problem.

In this survey, we examine the contributions of queueing theory (QT) in modeling EDs and assess the strengths and limitations of this application. We include a direct comparison to discrete-event simulation when applied to similar problems, and discuss data acquisition and challenges associated with each method. Specifically, we review applications of QT from the perspective of demand- and supply-side problems, as well as various methodological innovations developed to address the complexities of ED operations. In reviewing relevant articles published since 1970, we found that queueing models tend to oversimplify operations and underestimate congestion levels (especially for smaller systems), and obtain less realistic results than comparable simulation models. The combination of queueing and simulation is shown to be a powerful approach. Future efforts should exploit this and more widely available real-world data.

This paper studies the contract design problems for a service seller who consigns the service to a vendor. The vendor’s service cost parameter may or may not completely be known by the seller, which constitutes the cases of information symmetry or asymmetry. In both cases, the optimal contracts are developed to maximize the seller’s expected profit, with the consideration of contractible and non-contractible service qualities. The properties of the contract parameters are explored, along with the analysis of information rent and value of cost information. Moreover, we find that non-contractible service quality is not an issue for the service seller under cost information symmetry since a revenue-sharing type of contract can guarantee the seller’s profit. However, this result does not hold under cost information asymmetry and thus non-contractibility of the service quality indeed costs the seller.

This study considers the problem in which a demand-enhancing service can be provided by different supply chain parties, resulting in four alternative service channels: (a) manufacturer undertaking service, namely M-channel, (b) retailer undertaking service, namely R-channel, (c) manufacturer outsourcing service to third-party (3P), namely M-3P-channel, and (d) retailer outsourcing service to 3P, namely R-3P-channel. We quantitatively model these service channels and derive the optimal decisions with the following observations: When the service costs are equal for the different parties, there is a conflict in service channel choice since both the manufacturer and the retailer prefer to undertake the service or hire the 3P by themselves, although M-channel generates the highest market demand and system profit, When the service costs are different among these parties, R-channel and 3P-channels are more preferable if the service cost is less sensitive to the service level and if the market demand is more sensitive to the service level. We also conduct an empirical study to test some of the insights developed from the analytical models, our empirical findings support the analytical results.

In this paper, we discuss the operations of these nurse lines, based on studies in the literature and interviews with nurse line researchers and practitioners. This leads us to identify issues relevant for the design and management of such lines, challenges that operations research (OR)/operations management (OM) can help address. We demonstrate that a classical call center modelling approach, focusing exclusively on congestion, will be insufficient in addressing these challenges. Thus, we motivate research on an integrated framework in which both congestion and decision-making accuracy are coupled. We summarise the limited extant research in OR/OM that is applicable to the unique challenges posed by nurse lines, highlighting these models’ contributions, as well as the questions they leave unanswered. These questions provide significant opportunities for future research.

We develop a two-phased predictive system that produces forecasts of transfer passenger flows at an airport. In the first phase, the system predicts the distribution of individual transfer passengers’ connection times. In the second phase, the system samples from the distribution of individual connection times and produces distributional forecasts for the number of passengers arriving at the immigration and security areas. Academic/practical relevance: To our knowledge, this work is the first to apply machine learning for predicting real-time distributional forecasts of journeys in an airport using passenger level data. Better forecasts of these journeys can help optimize passenger experience and improve airport resource deployment. Methodology: The predictive system developed is based on a regression tree combined with copula-based simulations. We generalize the tree method to predict distributions, moving beyond point forecasts. We also formulate a newsvendor-based resourcing problem to evaluate decisions made by applying the new predictive system. Results: We show that, when compared with benchmarks, our two-phased approach is more accurate in predicting both connection times and passenger flows. Our approach also has the potential to reduce resourcing costs at the immigration and transfer security areas. Managerial implications: Our predictive system can produce accurate forecasts frequently and in real time. With these forecasts, an airport’s operating team can make data-driven decisions, identify late passengers, and assist them to make their connections. The airport can also update its resourcing plans based on the prediction of passenger flows. Our predictive system can be generalized to other operations management domains, such as hospitals or theme parks, in which customer flows need to be accurately predicted.

With increasing number of repairs, the repaired components will become more fragile and need more time to repair when they fail. In such case, the repair facility might suffer a “congestion” dilemma if the failed components cannot be repaired immediately. This paper investigates the reliability improvement of a k-out-of-n:F system under repair-rate differentiation policy, which might decrease the expected waiting time for repair without an increase in repair capacity. First, by comparing the mean queue-length in front of the repair facility, we show that the mixed-repair policy developed in this paper is dominant over the pure-repair policy in relieving the repair congestion problem. Then, we derive the optimal solution under the repair-rate differentiation policy, which minimizes the expected waiting time for repair of the failed components. Finally, when the buffer area is exhausted or component deterioration becomes too severe, the time of batch replacement is proposed in a practical example of the textile mill.

We refer to such a factor as the scaling parameter and it potentially has a profound impact on the design of staffing rules. We propose an new model to capture the scaling parameter in this paper.

The supplier and buyer’s demand forecasting are private information to each part and cause asymmetric information in the outsourcing contract design. Three different forecast scenarios are studied, including Non-Information Sharing, Information Sharing, and Buyer Forecasting case.

This paper studies the contracting for an outsourcing supply chain (a user company vs. a service provider) in the presence of co-opetition and information asymmetry. The user company outsources part of his service capacity at a discount price to the service provider for sale. The service provider charges a commission for doing outsourcing work and competes with the user company for the service capacity to satisfy their respective demands. We solve for the service provider’s optimal commission decision and the user company’s optimal outsourcing decisions (outsourcing volume and price discount) when the user company has private information about his service capacity. Specifically, we highlight the following observations. For the service provider, a menu of two-part tariffs that consist of a fixed commission and a per-volume commission can reveal the true type of the user company’s capacity, the user company’s optimal outsourcing proportion is quasi-convex and the optimal price discount is non-decreasing in his capacity volume, which is counterintuitive.

We also concentrate on the subcontracting situation, where the city hospital plays a dominating role, offering contracts to induce the community hospital to follow the optimal mutual referral strategy. We introduce two complex contracts: fee-for-service via cost sharing (FFS-CS) and pay-for-performance via cost sharing (P4P-CS) to coordinate, and find that both contracts coordinate effectively, regardless of the scale of the system. In addition, we discuss four extreme cases: fee-for-service via no cost sharing (FFS-NCS), fee-for-service via total cost sharing (FFS-TCS), pay-for-performance via no cost sharing (P4P-NCS), and pay-for-performance via total cost sharing (P4P-TCS) and find that some can coordinate the health care system under certain circumstances, whereas others cannot. Through the numerical examples we discuss the applicability of the coordinating contracts and further find that FFS-CS outperforms P4P-CS in terms of applicability.

Academic/practical relevance: We propose a parsimonious game theory framework, in which two firms dynamically choose whether to accept each other’s customers without the capability to perfectly monitor each other’s capacity utilization state. Methodology: We solve the continuous-time imperfect-monitoring game by focusing on a class of public strategy, in which firms’ real-time capacity-sharing decision depends on an intuitive and easy-to-implement accounting device, namely the current net number of transferred customers. We refer to such an equilibrium as a trading-favors equilibrium. We characterize the condition in which capacity sharing takes place in such an equilibrium. Results: We find that some degree of efficiency loss (as compared with a central planner’s solution) is necessary to induce reciprocity. The efficiency loss is small when the two firms have similar traffic intensity even if they are different in service-capacity scale, whereas the efficiency loss can be considerably large when the two firms have significantly different traffic intensities. The trading-favors mechanism, surprisingly, can outperform the perfect-monitoring benchmark when the two firms exhibit high asymmetry in terms of service-capacity scale or traffic intensity because the smaller firm tends to deviate from collaboration. Managerial implications: Firms should consider engaging in nonmonetary reciprocal capacity sharing if regulations, transaction costs, or other market and operational frictions make it difficult to use a capacity-sharing contract based on monetary payments. The trading-favors collaboration can improve the firms’ payoff close to the centralized upper bound when the firms have similar traffic intensities. However, when their traffic intensities are highly different, firms are better off with a monetary-payment contract to induce more capacity sharing and are worse off investing in increasing their visibility to each other’s real-time available capacity, namely investing in perfect monitoring.

In order to stabilize performance at class-dependent delay targets, we propose the blind (model-free) head-of-line delay-ratio (HLDR) scheduling rule, which extends an earlier dynamic-priority rule that exploits the head-of-line delay information. We study the HLDR rule in the quality-and-efficiency-driven many-server heavy-traffic (MSHT) regime. We staff to the MSHT fluid limit plus a control function in the diffusion scale. We establish a MSHT limit for the Markov model, which has dramatic state-space collapse, showing that the targeted ratios are attained asymptotically. In the MSHT limit, meeting staffing goals reduces to a one-dimensional control problem for the aggregate queue content, which may be approximated by recently developed staffing algorithms for time-varying single-class models. Simulation experiments confirm that the overall procedure can be effective, even for non-Markov models. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/stsy.2018.0015.

Despite its conceptual elegance, the operationalization of this process is challenging due to the various sources of randomness involved. The purpose of this paper is to help call centers enhance service levels while keeping operating expenses low by taking advantage of an on-call pool of temporary agents in day-to-day operations. For that purpose, we develop a two-stage decision model in which the first stage seeks the optimal mix of permanent and on-call staff, and the second stage seeks a joint on-demand staffing and call scheduling policy to minimize the associated cost given the base staffing level and the size of the on-call pool. Because the exact analysis of the two-stage decision model seems analytically intractable, we resort to an approximation in a suitable asymptotic regime. In that regime, we characterize the system dynamics of the service operation and derive an optimal joint on-demand staffing and call scheduling policy for the second-stage problem, which in turn is used to find an approximate solution to the first-stage problem. In particular, the derived policy for the second-stage problem involves tapping into the on-call pool to procure a team of on-demand agents when the number of calls to be processed exceeds a certain threshold and dismissing them when it falls below another threshold, additionally, the call scheduling rule shows an unusual pattern due to the interplay between staffing and scheduling decisions. Extensive numerical studies under realistic parameter settings show that the solution approach we propose can achieve significant cost savings. Funding: W.

These findings stimulate the needs for more practical non-Poisson customer arrival models, and more importantly, new staffing formulas to account for the autocorrelative features in the arrival model. For this purpose, we study a multiserver queueing system where customer arrivals follow a doubly stochastic Poisson point process whose intensities are driven by a Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) process. The nonnegativity and autoregressive feature of the CIR process makes it a good candidate for modeling temporary dips and surges in arrivals. First, we devise an effective statistical procedure to calibrate our new arrival model to data which can be seen as a specification of the celebrated expectation–maximization algorithm. Second, we establish functional limit theorems for the CIR process, which in turn facilitate the derivation of functional limit theorems for our queueing model under suitable heavy-traffic regimes. Third, using the corresponding heavy traffic limits, we asymptotically solve an optimal staffing problem subject to delay-based constraints on the service levels. We find that, in order to achieve the designated service level, such an autoregressive feature in the arrival model translates into notable adjustment in the staffing formula, and such an adjustment can be fully characterized by the parameters of our new arrival model. In this respect, the staffing formulas acknowledge the presence of autoregressive structure in arrivals. Finally, we extend our analysis to queues having customer abandonment and conduct simulation experiments to provide engineering confirmations of our new staffing rules.

There are a large number of customers to be served daily, however, required service resources (in particular, customer service representatives) can be rather limited. Therefore, customer service representative scheduling is a challenging problem for bank managers. In the present paper, we focus on a customer service representative scheduling problem considering the stochastic customer arrival time and service duration to minimise the total cost including two parts: (i) the loss concerning the customer waiting and (ii) cost of providing service representatives. We formulate this scheduling problem as an integer programming problem and employ an adapted water wave optimization (WWO) algorithm to solve this problem efficiently. We adapt the propagation and refraction operators of WWO according to the solution space of this problem. The results of the conducted computational experiments demonstrate that the adapted WWO algorithm outperforms the considered state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in solving a set of test instances.

A prerequisite for such a system is comprehensive operational information (e.g. queueing times, busy resources,…), reliably portraying and predicting ED status as it evolves in time. To this end, simulation comes to the rescue, through a two-step procedure that is hereby proposed for supporting real-time ED control. In the first step, an ED manager infers the ED's current state, based on historical data and simulation: data is fed into the simulator (e.g. via location-tracking systems, such as RFID tags), and the simulator then completes unobservable state-components. In the second step, and based on the inferred present state, simulation supports control by predicting future ED scenarios. To this end, we estimate time-varying resource requirements via a novel simulation-based technique that utilizes the notion of offered-load.

Once the arrival rate becomes known, the call center may be over-staffed, in which case staff are being paid to be idle, or under-staffed, in which case many callers hang-up in the face of long wait times. Firms that have chosen to keep their call center operations in-house can mitigate this problem by co-sourcing, that is, by sometimes outsourcing calls. Then, the required staffing N depends on how the firm chooses which calls to outsource in real time, after the arrival rate realizes and the call center operates as a M/M/N + M queue with an outsourcing option. Our objective is to find a joint policy for staffing and call outsourcing that minimizes the long-run average cost of this two-stage stochastic program when there is a linear staffing cost per unit time and linear costs associated with abandonments and outsourcing. We propose a policy that uses a square-root safety staffing rule, and outsources calls in accordance with a threshold rule that characterizes when the system is “too crowded.” Analytically, we establish that our proposed policy is asymptotically optimal, as the mean arrival rate becomes large, when the level of uncertainty in the arrival rate is of the same order as the inherent system fluctuations in the number of waiting customers for a known arrival rate. Through an extensive numerical study, we establish that our policy is extremely robust. In particular, our policy performs remarkably well over a wide range of parameters, and far beyond where it is proved to be asymptotically optimal.

The Japanese seru production system has received increased attention owing to its high efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, the problem of seru production system formation under uncertain demand is researched. A multi-objective optimization model for a seru production system formation problem is developed to minimize the cost and maximize the service level of the system. The purpose of this paper is to formulate a robust production system that can respond efficiently to the stochastic demand. Sample average approximation (SAA) is used to approximate the expected objective of the stochastic programming. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is improved to solve the multi-objective optimization model. Numerical experiments are conducted to test the tradeoff between cost and service level, and how the performance of the seru production system varies with the number of product types, mean and deviation of product volume, and skill-level-based cost.

However, only a few published articles have considered reference effects in supply chain quality management. In practice, reference effects influence consumer purchasing behaviours. Therefore, we have developed a dynamic model that incorporates the effects of the reference quality and reference price on the demand function of a ‘single-supplier single-manufacturer’ supply chain system. In our model, the demand function is assumed to be influenced by the reference price and reference quality. The reference price formation is assumed to be affected by the gap between quality and the reference quality. By utilizing differential game theory, we calculate and compare the open-loop equilibrium quality levels in two different scenarios: (i) Each channel member makes decisions within a subsidy programme and (ii) the supplier vertically integrates with the manufacturer. In addition, a total cost-sharing contract based on quality improvement efforts is proposed and proven to be effective in the supply chain system that is under consideration.

Firms have the choice of either operating their own production/service facilities or investing in a facility that is shared. Facilities are modeled as queueing systems with finite service rates. Firms decide on capacity levels (the service rate) to minimize delay costs and capacity investment costs possibly subject to service-level constraints on delay. If firms decide to operate a shared facility they must also decide on a scheme for sharing the capacity cost. We formulate the problem as a cooperative game and identify settings under which capacity sharing is beneficial and there is a cost allocation that is in the core under either the first-come, first-served policy or an optimal priority policy. We show that capacity sharing may not be beneficial in settings where firms have heterogeneous work contents and service variabilities. In such cases, we specify conditions under which capacity sharing may still be beneficial for a subset of the firms.

We show that by randomly assigning customers different service grades with different service rates, the average waiting time can be reduced without affecting the mean service time. Such differentiation introduces more service time variability, but it also creates information that enables the implementation of service rate-based scheduling, which mitigates the increased variance and may even reduce the total waiting time. We provide conditions under which our static service differentiation reduces waiting, and further derive closed-form expressions for the optimal differentiation policy, which shows that both optimal service rates and allocation probabilities form geometric sequences. We illustrate our policy in the context of quality-based service domains, in which customers value service time but dislike waiting. Numerically, we find that providing differentiated service can improve system performance by 5% without any additional capacity.

A specialist cannot choose a patient according to his specialty. Because of the “worship of famous doctors” and asymmetric information between specialists and patients, the appointments are often made with certain blindness, thus it is difficult for patients to get the best diagnosis and treatment from specialists. In this paper, we apply the two-sided matching theory, from the both views of patients and specialists, we design specialists-outpatients matching appointment system, in the system, we propose the process of the appointment and the one-to-many appointment matching algorithm. In order to provide fairness to both sides, we apply the theory of balance-matching, construct the algorithm of one-to-one and one-to-many two-sided balance matching. At last, through the computational examples we prove the model is effective in hospital specialists outpatient appointment.

To clarify future research directions of operations research (OR) in the service industry, the state of art of OR has been examined systematically, the new requirements of OR are identified for its applications in service industries in comparison with those in manufacturing industries, and the limitations of existing methodologies and tools have been discussed. This paper was intended to provide an updated review on how OR has been applied in the service sector in recent years and what directions the study of OR will be carried forward in the near future. Under a proposed research framework, recent OR-related articles were collected from 17 leading OR journals and classified into the five most active sectors, that is, transportation and warehousing, information and communication, human health and social assistance, retails and wholesales, and financial and insurance services. The conclusions on the limitations of existing studies and the demanding ORs in the service have been drawn from our summaries and observations from a comprehensive review in this field.

Under this IT problem-solving context, we analyze the learning curve relationship between problem-solving experience and performance enhancement. Based on data collected from a university computing call center consisting of different types of consultants, our empirical findings indicate that (a) the learning effect—as measured by the reduction of average resolution time—occurs with experience, (b) knowledge transfer within a group occurs among lower-level consultants utilizing application-level knowledge (as opposed to technical-level knowledge), and (c) knowledge transfers across IT problem types. These estimates of learning and knowledge transfer contribute to the development of an empirically grounded understanding of IT knowledge workers' learning behavior. The results also have implications for operational decisions about the staffing and problem-solving strategy of call centers.

Due to the difficulties in checking the feasibility of the probabilistic constraint and the non-convexity of the feasible region, chance constrained problems are generally solved through approximations. Joint chance constrained problem enforces that several constraints are satisfied simultaneously and it is more complicated than individual chance constrained problem. This work investigates the tractable robust optimization approximation framework for solving the joint chance constrained problem. Various robust counterpart optimization formulations are derived based on different types of uncertainty set. To improve the quality of robust optimization approximation, a two-layer algorithm is proposed. The inner layer optimizes over the size of the uncertainty set, and the outer layer optimizes over the parameter t which is used for the indicator function upper bounding. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed method can lead to solutions close to the true solution of a joint chance constrained problem.

Our approach integrates demographic and survival analysis, discrete event simulation, and optimization. Based on this methodology, we developed a decision support system for use in practice. We illustrate this approach through two case studies: one for a regional health authority in British Columbia, Canada, and the other for a long-term care facility. We also compare our approach to the fixed ratio approach used in practice and the SIPP (stationary, independent, period by period) and MOL (modified offered load) approaches developed in the call center literature. Our results suggest that our approach is preferable. The fixed ratio approach lacks a rigorous foundation, and the SIPP and MOL approaches do not perform reliably mainly because of long service times. We conclude the paper with policy recommendations.

In general, most common mainstream interface for a hand-held AR/MR system is video-see-through style with a device-perspective view. On the other hand, our method provides a user-perspective view, which displays MR images according to the user's viewpoint and the position of the display. Namely, our method trims a scene behind the display and superimposes CG images in consideration of the user's point of view. This enables the user to perceive a stereoscopic effect with a non-3D display based on pseudo motion parallax. We implemented a prototype and tested our proposed method on smartphones.

Specifically, for any delay target w > 0 and probability target α ∈ (0, 1), we determine appropriate staffing levels (the st) so that the time-varying probability that the waiting time exceeds a maximum acceptable value w is stabilized at α at all times. In addition, effective approximating formulas are provided for other important performance functions such as the probabilities of delay and abandonment, and the means of delay and queue length. Many-server heavy-traffic limit theorems in the efficiency-driven regime are developed to show that (i) the proposed staffing function achieves the goal asymptotically as the scale increases, and (ii) the proposed approximating formulas for other performance measures are asymptotically accurate as the scale increases. Extensive simulations show that both the staffing functions and the performance approximations are effective, even for smaller systems having an average of three servers.

The fluid model has time-varying arrival rate and service capacity, abandonment from queue, and non-exponential service and patience distributions. Two key assumptions are that: (i) the system alternates between overloaded and underloaded intervals, and (ii) the functions specifying the fluid model are suitably smooth. An algorithm is developed to calculate all performance functions. It involves the iterative solution of a fixed-point equation for the time-varying rate that fluid enters service and the solution of an ordinary differential equation for the time-varying head-of-line waiting time, during each overloaded interval.

Our objective is to devise proper staffing and scheduling schemes to achieve differentiated services for each class. Formally, for a class-specific delay target w i >0 and threshold α i ∈(0,1) , we concurrently determine an appropriate staffing level (number of servers) and a server-assignment rule (assigning newly idle servers to a waiting customer from one of the classes), under which the percentage of class-i customers waiting more than w i does not exceed α i . We tackle the problem under the efficiency-driven many-server heavy-traffic limiting regime, where both the demand volume and the number of servers grow proportionally to infinity. Our main findings are as follows: (a) class-level service differentiation is obtained by using a delay-based dynamic prioritization scheme, (b) the proposed scheduling rule achieves an important state-space collapse, in which all waiting time processes evolve as fixed proportions of a one-dimensional state-descriptor called the frontier process, (c) the frontier process solves a stochastic Volterra equation and is thus a non-Markovian process, (d) the proposed staffing-and-scheduling solution can be readily extended to time-varying settings. In this paper, we establish heavy-traffic limit theorems to show that our solution is asymptotically correct for large systems, and we numerically demonstrate that it performs reasonably well even for relatively small systems.

The formulas are based on recently established Gaussian many-server heavy-traffic limits in the efficiency-driven (ED) regime, where the traffic intensity is fixed at ρ > 1, but the approximations also apply to systems in the quality-and-ED regime, where ρ > 1 but ρ is close to 1. Good performance across a wide range of parameters is obtained by making heuristic refinements, the main one being truncation of the queue length and waiting time approximations to nonnegative values. Simulation experiments show that the proposed approximations are effective for large-scale queuing systems for a significant range of the traffic intensity ρ and the abandonment rate θ, roughly for ρ > 1.02 and θ > 2.0. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Proportions of the fluid completing service from each queue are immediately routed to the other queues, with the fluid not routed to one of the queues being immediately routed out of the network. The fluid queue network serves as an approximation for the corresponding non-Markovian open network of many-server queues with Markovian routing, where all model elements may be time varying. We establish the existence of a unique vector of (net) arrival rate functions at each queue and the associated time-varying performance. In doing so, we provide the basis for an efficient algorithm, even for networks with many queues.

New offered-load and modified-offered-load approximations involving infinite-server models are developed for that purpose. Simulations show that the approximations are effective. A many-server heavy-traffic limit in the efficiency-driven regime shows that (i) the proposed approximations achieve the goal asymptotically as the scale increases, and (ii) it is not possible to simultaneously stabilize the mean queue length in the same asymptotic regime.

We model the call center as a G/G/s queue with customer abandonment. Each call has a revenue potential, and we model the call center's service quality by the percentage of calls resolved (revenue realized). The call center makes two strategic decisions: how many agents to have and how much effort to exert to achieve service quality. We are interested in the contracts the user company can use to induce the call center to both staff and exert effort at levels that are optimal for the outsourcing supply chain (i.e., chain coordination). Two commonly used contracts are analyzed first: piecemeal and pay-per-call-resolved contracts. We show that although they can coordinate the staffing level, the resulting service quality is below system optimum. Then, depending on the observability and contractibility of the call center's effort, we propose two contracts that can coordinate both staffing and effort. These contracts suggest that managers pay close attention to service quality and its contractibility in seeking call center outsourcing.

They are monitored periodically, and penalty and/or bonus payments are imposed in each performance review period, according to the SLA clauses. Previous studies have mostly considered a static inventory policy in analyzing SLAs. However, in practice, the supplier may have an opportunity to adjust the stock level in each inventory review period, according to the observed performance. This study analyzes the dynamic stocking decision for a supplier facing an SLA where the supplier sells a single product to the retailer. The ready rate is used to measure the performance in an SLA. To this end, models for both lump-sum and linear penalty/bonus structures are developed, and the optimal stocking decisions for a strategic supplier are calculated using the stochastic dynamic programming approach. The results are then compared with the optimal static inventory policy, and new insights are derived to efficiently design an inventory system for the suppliers that are subject to service-level incentives. In addition, we investigate the impact of SLA parameters—such as the length of the performance review period and incentive structures—on a supplier's performance, with the probability of meeting or exceeding the target service levels and the supplier's cost. We also consider the impact of demand distribution and inventory holding costs. Results show that under lump-sum incentives, a longer performance review period benefits both the supplier and the buyer, given that the average ready rate increases with less variability as the length of the performance review period increases, leading to decrements in the supplier's total costs. In this scenario, there is a higher chance of gaining bonuses/avoiding penalties for a strategic supplier who adopts a dynamic inventory policy. On the other hand, under linear incentives, the impact of the performance review period on the supplier's cost and the performance measure (i.e., ready rate) is complicated and depends on the magnitude of the holding cost and the bonus and/or penalty structure of the contract. Under this scheme, the performance of a static inventory policy is highly dependent on the holding cost because a high holding cost may lead to failure to meet the contract requirements in terms of the service level.

In a distributed queueing system, servers are shared among multiple queues, and they travel between queues in response to stochastic and time-varying demands. Although server traveling can improve service levels and shorten queue lengths, server routing and scheduling is complicated. We propose a dynamic programming model to solve this special routing-scheduling problem with time-varying demand, stochastic travel time, and queue-length constraints. In order to tackle large-scale practical instances, we design a dynamic programming-based rollout heuristic algorithm. Experiments on large-scale airports and scenic spots show that our approach reduces the total working periods of servers/employees without violating queue-length constraints. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing benchmark methods and the practical schedules of a scenic spot.

Call centers have been a fertile area for operations management researchers in several domains, including forecasting, capacity planning, queueing, and personnel scheduling. In addition, as telecommunications and information technology have advanced over the past several years, the operational challenges faced by call center managers have become more complicated. Issues associated with human resources management, sales, and marketing have also become increasingly relevant to call center operations and associated academic research. In this paper, we provide a survey of the recent literature on call center operations management. Along with traditional research areas, we pay special attention to new management challenges that have been caused by emerging technologies, to behavioral issues associated with both call center agents and customers, and to the interface between call center operations and sales and marketing. We identify a handful of broad themes for future investigation while also pointing out several very specific research opportunities.

Four models (baseline and optimised for current and future states) are developed and compared using simulation. We find significant differences for all performance metrics between three alternatives and baseline model for current state: (1) optimised model for current state achieves cost reduction (31.71%) and higher staff utilisation (63.14%), without significant capacity increase, and (2) baseline model for future state results in significant capacity gain (2.05%), with less significant cost reduction and utilisation. Furthermore, optimised model for future state obtains largest capacity gain (2.31%), greatest cost reduction (44.43%), and highest utilisation (93.43%). All models result in acceptable average queue length. Additionally, process improvement affects all performance metrics, especially capacity, whereas staffing optimisation influences all other performance metrics than capacity.

Therefore, the manufacturer has to face a problem of outsourcing warranty contract design to deal with the fraud of the agents in service. Considering a price-and-service-sensitive demand, we studied two warranty-outsourcing contracts (the fixed-price contract and the cost-based contract) in a supply chain setting comprising one risk-neutral manufacturer and one risk-averse service agent. The results show that, when the market is sensitive to warranty service, the cost-based contract benefits the manufacturer in demand promotion. Interestingly, even if the cost-based contract increases the amount of consumers for the service agent, the fixed-price contract always benefits the agent with low risk-aversion level.

In this study, the discussion on the causes of educational service quality was complemented from the perspective of social network, especially through analysis at the team level. A total of 478 copies of social network questionnaires were collected from 15 educational teams. Meanwhile, targeting at the educational institutions' customers, the service quality survey was conducted with 1,487 copies of valid samples in total. The results indicate that individual-level social capital in the form of trust relations positively influences educational service quality. Among the group level factors, group centrality and number of cliques have a significant impact on group members' service quality, which also moderate the effect of trust on service quality.

We show that under most plausible scenarios in KIBS outsourcing, there is an intrinsic tension between vendor selection and contract efficiency: in the process in which the winning vendor's bid constitutes the terms of the contract between client and vendor (e.g., competitive bidding), there is good selection but contract inefficiency (positive information rent paid by the client). If, by contrast, the client establishes the contract terms, then its performance yields contract efficiency but poor selection. We also highlight the implications of performance metrics for contract design in KIBS outsourcing.

Conventional wisdom suggests that pooling agents reduce customer wait time while performance bonuses motivate agents to produce high-quality service, both of which should boost customer satisfaction. However, our queueing-game-theoretic analysis reveals that when agents act strategically, they may choose to speed up under pooling in an attempt to serve more customers, thus undermining service quality. If this happens, pooling can backfire and result in both lower customer satisfaction and agent payoff. We propose a simple solution to resolve this issue: pooling a portion of the performance bonuses (incentive pooling) in conjunction with pooling agents (operational pooling).

In such systems, customers of multiple classes are routed to servers of multiple skills. In the settings we consider, each server skill is associated with a corresponding cost, and service level can either appear as a strong constraint or incur a cost. The solution we propose is based on the Stochastic Approximation (SA) approach. Since SBR models are analytically intractable in general, we use computer simulation to evaluate service-level measures. Under the assumption of convexity of the service-level as functions in staffing levels, SA provides an analytical proof of convergence, together with a rate of convergence. We show, via numerical examples, that although the convexity assumption does not hold for all cases and all types of service-level objectives, the algorithm nevertheless identifies the optimal solution.
