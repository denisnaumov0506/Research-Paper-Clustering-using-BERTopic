To meet the rising expectation of high-quality services, efficiently allocating resources is vital for service systems to balance service qualities with costs. In particular, this paper focuses on a class of resource allocation problems where the service-level objective and constraints are in the form of probabilistic measures. Further, process complexity and system dynamics in service systems often render their performance evaluation and optimization challenging and relying on simulation models. To this end, we propose a generalized resource allocation model with probabilistic measures, and subsequently, develop an optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) formulation to select the optimal solution subject to random noises in simulation. The OCBA formulation minimizes the expected opportunity cost that penalizes based on the quality of the selected solution. Further, the formulation takes a Bayesian approach to consider the prior knowledge and potential performance correlations on candidate solutions. Then, the asymptotic optimality conditions of the formulation are derived, and an iterative algorithm is developed accordingly. Numerical experiments and a case study inspired by a real-world problem in a hospital emergency department demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for solving the resource allocation problem via simulation.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1059-1478,1937-5956,,,,,,,"Rutgers State Univ, Dept Supply Chain Management, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USACity Univ Hong Kong, Dept Adv Design & Syst Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaSouthern Univ Sci & Technol, Acad Adv Interdisciplinary Studies, Shenzhen, Peoples R ChinaSouthern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R ChinaFudan Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,,,2022-09-10,WOS:000849848600001,,,atlason_et_al_2007

In this work, we propose a stochastic queueing network model of patient flow in the ED and study an associated fluid control problem to guide the reassignment decision for two types of nursing staff.

Analytical results and simulation experiments suggest a significant reduction of waiting times in parameter regimes relevant to the ED setting.

In this paper, a two-stage approach is proposed to tackle the problem, where the former generates preliminary solutions satisfying all the hard constraints, and the latter refines the solutions by fulfilling soft constraints as much as possible. The proposed approach employs artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm as the main search framework in both stages, and appropriate neighborhood structures are designed respectively.

Our joint chance-constrained formulation is more rational capturing the correlation between different call types, as compared to separate chance-constrained versions considered in previous studies. We show that, in general, the probability functions in the joint-chance constraints display S-shaped curves, and the optimal solutions should belong to the concave regions of the curves. Thus, we propose an approach combining a heuristic phase to identify solutions lying in the concave part and a simulation-based cut generation phase to create outer-approximations of the probability functions. This allows us to find good staffing solutions satisfying the joint-chance constraints by simulation and linear programming.

In this article, we study the dynamic assignment of servers to different areas of a service system at the beginning of discrete time intervals, namely, shifts. The ability to reassign servers at discrete intervals, rather than continuously, introduces a partial flexibility that provides an opportunity for reducing the expected waiting time of customers. The problem is primarily motivated by an application to nurse staffing in emergency departments (EDs), where nurses can work in different areas of the ED, but their assignment can only be changed at the beginning of their shifts (typically 8-12 hours). To investigate the reassignment decision and its potential benefits, we consider a multiclass queueing system, where customers of each class differ in terms of their average service requirements and the holding cost incurred as they wait in the queues. We study a discrete-time fluid control problem to minimize transient holding costs over a finite horizon and show that an appropriate translation of the solution to the fluid control problem is asymptotically optimal for the original stochastic system. Through analysis of the fluid control problem we further obtain insights on the structure of good policies in the presence of the shift constraint. Leveraging these insights, we develop heuristic policies and use simulation to demonstrate their effectiveness in systems with dynamics often observed in EDs. We find that, in a parameter regime relevant to our motivating application, the partial flexibility introduced by reassigning servers at the beginning of shifts can substantially reduce the expected cost of the system-by 10%-50% in some parameter regimes-compared with the status quo, dedicated staffing.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,0030-364X,,,,,,,,"Columbia Business Sch, Div Decis Risk & Operat, New York, NY 10027 USAUniv Southern Calif Los Angeles, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USAUniv Toronto, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 3G8, Canada",Univ Southern Calif Los Angeles,,,2021-11-02,WOS:000709027800001,,,atlason_et_al_2007

We study asample average approximation(SAA) approach that uses nested sampling, in which at each stage, a number of scenarios are examined and a number of simulation replications are performed for each scenario to estimate the next-stage constraints. This approach provides an approximate solution to the multistage problem. To establish the consistency of the SAA approach, we first consider a two-stage problem and show that in the second-stage problem, given a scenario, the optimal values and solutions of the SAA converge to those of the true problem with probability one when the sample sizes go to infinity. These convergence results do not hold uniformly over all possible scenarios for the second stage problem. We are nevertheless able to prove that the optimal values and solutions of the SAA converge to the true ones with probability one when the sample sizes at both stages increase to infinity. We also prove exponential convergence of the probability of a large deviation for the optimal value of the SAA, the true value of an optimal solution of the SAA, and the probability that any optimal solution to the SAA is an optimal solution of the true problem. All of these results can be extended to a multistage setting and we explain how to do it. Our framework and SAA results cover a large variety of resource allocation problems for which at each stage after the first one, new information becomes available and the allocation can be readjusted, under constraints that involve expectations estimated by Monte Carlo. As an illustration, we apply this SAA method to a staffing problem in a call center, in which the goal is to optimize the numbers of agents of each type under some constraints on the quality of service (QoS). The staffing allocation has to be decided under an uncertain arrival rate with a prior distribution in the first stage, and can be adjusted at some additional cost when better information on the arrival rate becomes available in later stages.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,0025-5610,1436-4646,,,,,,,"Phenikaa Univ, Fac Comp Sci, ORLab, Hanoi, VietnamSingapore MIT Alliance Res & Technol SMART, Singapore, SingaporeUniv Montreal, Dept Comp Sci & Operat Res, Montreal, PQ, CanadaCIRRELT, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Phenikaa Univ,,,2020-06-25,WOS:000539847100001,,,atlason_et_al_2007

We develop a TunT (Transform-unTransform) estimator that turns the difficult problem of nonparametric hazard function estimation into a regression problem on binned and right-censored data. Our approach starts with binning event times and transforming event count data with a mean-matching transformation, which enables a simpler characterization of the heteroscedastic variance function.

In this paper, we describe a simulation-optimization method for fare-collection shift scheduling in a subway network. We use an integer programming model to generate shift schedules and a discrete-event simulation model to evaluate the corresponding service levels in terms of the average number of users waiting in line over time. If the expected service level at a particular station booth does not meet a predefined service standard, then our method automatically generates an additional constraint on the number of fare collectors at that station booth. The proposed approach iteratively adds this new constraint to the integer programming model until either the current schedule meets the service standard or the problem becomes infeasible.

Hazard functions offer dynamic characterization of customer waiting behavior, and provide critical inputs for agent scheduling. Motivated by this application, we develop a two-way functional hazards (tF-Hazards) model to study customer waiting behavior as a function of two timescales, waiting duration and the time of day that a customer calls in. The model stems from a two-way piecewise constant hazard function, and imposes low-rank structure and smoothness on the hazard rates to enhance interpretability.

Answering these questions involves trading off two types of error inherent in the iterates: the deterministic error due to recursion and the stochastic error due to sampling. As we demonstrate through a characterization of the relationship between sample sizing and convergence rates, efficiency and consistency are intimately coupled with the speed of the underlying recursion, with faster recursions yielding a wider regime of optimal sampling rates.

In this case study, we generate and analyze discrete-event systems simulation-optimization models to test the behavior of a real-world call center under the actual configuration and under different levels of cross-training.

Scenario reduction aims at selecting a small number of scenarios to represent a large set of scenarios for decision making, so as to significantly reduce the computational complexity while preserving the solution quality of using a large number of scenarios. In this work, a new computationally efficient scenario reduction algorithm is proposed based on transportation distance minimization. The proposed algorithm relies on solving linear programming problems. The scenario subset updating step and the probability value assignment step are performed in an iterative manner until the transportation distance converges. Comparison with existing scenario reduction methods reveals that the proposed method is very efficient for the reduction of large scenario set.

Following standard practice, the day is divided into time periods of equal length (e.g., 15 or 30 minutes), the arrival rate is assumed random but constant in time in each period, and the arrivals are from a Poisson process, conditional on the rate. The random rate for each period is taken as a deterministic base rate (or expected rate) multiplied by a random busyness factor having mean 1. Models in which the busyness factors are independent across periods, or in which a common busyness factor applies to all periods, have been studied previously. But they are not sufficiently realistic. We examine alternative models for which the busyness factors have some form of dependence across periods. Maximum likelihood parameter estimation for these models is not easy, mainly because the arrival rates themselves are never observed. We develop specialized techniques to perform this estimation. We compare the goodness-of-fit of these models on arrival data from three call centers, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Our models can represent arrivals in many other types of systems as well. Estimating a model for the vector of counts (the number of arrivals in each period) is generally easier than for the vector of rates, because the counts can be observed, but a model for the rates is often more convenient and natural, e.g., for simulation. We examine and provide insight on the relationship between these two types of modeling. In particular, we give explicit formulas for the relationship between the correlation between rates and that between counts in two given periods, and for the variance and dispersion index in a given period. These formulas imply that for a given correlation between the rates, the correlation between the counts is much smaller in low traffic than in high traffic.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,0030-364X,,,,,,,,"Univ Montreal, Dept Informat & Rech Operat, Pavillon Aisenstadt, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",,,,2016-05-25,WOS:000375603700018,,,atlason_et_al_2007

Shared norms and attitudes concerning knowledge, IT use, and responsibility for different call types within teams were associated with redirecting practices which lead to the problematic rerouting of calls. Problems with call routing and rerouting negatively affected operational efficiency and undermined customer satisfaction.Research limitations/implications - The paper is based upon a single case study so further research is required to examine how problems identified are manifest in call centre operations of different size and complexity. The qualitative approach develops rich insights but these findings would benefit from a quantitative focus in the future.Practical implications - The customer experience of IVR systems should be continually monitored to identify usability problems and ensure effective design, while call centre management should attempt to increase teams' awareness of and ability to successfully redirect incorrectly routed calls.Originality/value - The paper conceptualises the mutual influence of macro-level service system design and the micro-level behaviour of customers and agents upon each other. In practice, formal design decisions such as input uncertainty, decoupling, and interdependence patterns are continually reproduced or modified.

In this paper, we address the question of what is the optimal (least conservative) robust optimization approximation for the chance constrained optimization problems. A novel algorithm is proposed to find the smallest possible uncertainty set size that leads to the optimal robust optimization approximation. The proposed method first identifies the maximum set size that leads to feasible robust optimization problems and then identifies the best set size that leads to the desired probability of constraint satisfaction.

However, this raises a critical question: How can one predict the service delivery cost that will deliver the promised service level agreements (SLAs)? This is particularly challenging since such prediction is mostly needed during the service engagement phase where the SLAs and the delivery cost are negotiated, and the detailed service modeling data are not available.

To clarify future research directions of operations research (OR) in the service industry, the state of art of OR has been examined systematically, the new requirements of OR are identified for its applications in service industries in comparison with those in manufacturing industries, and the limitations of existing methodologies and tools have been discussed. This paper was intended to provide an updated review on how OR has been applied in the service sector in recent years and what directions the study of OR will be carried forward in the near future. Under a proposed research framework, recent OR-related articles were collected from 17 leading OR journals and classified into the five most active sectors, that is, transportation and warehousing, information and communication, human health and social assistance, retails and wholesales, and financial and insurance services. The conclusions on the limitations of existing studies and the demanding ORs in the service have been drawn from our summaries and observations from a comprehensive review in this field.

These errors may lead to the rejection of the major portion of the production and hence result the manufacturer a huge loss. The problem is decomposed to have two objective functions; one is a sum-of-fractional objectives and the other is a non-linear objective with bounded constraints. The interest is to maximize the sum-of-fractional objectives and to minimize the non-linear objective, subject to stochastic and non-stochastic bounded environment. The first problem deals with the maximization of the profit (maximizing sum-of-fractional objectives) and the second deals with the minimization of the loss (errors), so as to obtain the maximum profit after removing the number of defective PCBs.

The study introduces two iterative heuristic algorithms, which combine simulation and optimization models for scheduling the work shifts of the ED resources: physicians, nurses and technicians. The algorithms are distinctive because they account for patients being treated by multiple care providers, possibly over the course of several hours, often with interspersed waiting. In such instances, patient arrival time is not a good indicator of when the various care providers are needed. The algorithms were tested using a detailed simulation based on data from five general hospital EDs. A patient's Length of Stay (LOS) is measured as the time a patient spends in the ED until being admitted to the hospital or discharged. The first algorithm achieved an average reduction of between 20 and 45% in the total patient waiting time, which led to a reduction of between 7 and 17% in the combined average patient LOS. By allowing a restructure of the ED resource capacities, the second algorithm achieved an average reduction of between 20 and 64% in the total patient waiting time, leading to an 11 to 29% reduction in the combined average patient LOS.",,,,,,,,,27,1,0,0,1,0,28,,,0740-817X,1545-8830,,,,,,,"CIRRELT, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, CanadaTechnion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Technion, Haifa, IsraelEcole Polytech, Dept Math & Ind Engn, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, CanadaTech Univ Eindhoven, Dept Ind Engn & Innovat Sci Operat Planning Accou, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands",,,,2012-04-18,WOS:000302014600001,,,atlason_et_al_2007

This paper is motivated by work with a provider of outsourced technical support services where call volumes exhibit significant variability and uncertainty. The outsourcing contract specifies a Service Level Agreement that must be satisfied over an extended period of a week or month. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer stochastic program. Our model has two distinctive features. Firstly, we combine the server sizing and staff scheduling steps into a single optimization program. Secondly, we explicitly recognize the uncertainty in period-by-period arrival rates. We show that the stochastic formulation, in general, calculates a higher cost optimal schedule than a model which ignores variability, but that the expected cost of this schedule is lower. We conduct extensive experimentation to compare the solutions of the stochastic program with the deterministic programs, based on mean valued arrivals.

The paper aims to investigate the value of a time-dependent approach to determine staffing levels without making an assumption that call centers to be a queuing model in a steady state.Design/methodology/approach - Staffing is usually accomplished through the use of simple queuing models, Erlang-C (M/M/c). It is common to adopt a stationary independent period by period (SIPP) approach. However, staffing based on SIPP does not consider uncompleted calls and each planning interval cannot achieve a steady state in most cases, since the lengths of planning intervals are short in fact. In this context, the CSS approach considers uncompleted calls and determines staffing levels by using simulation.Findings - Staffing based on the CSS approach needed fewer agents, compared with staffing based on the SIPP approach. Hiring less agents during a single planning horizon lead to a decrease in total operational costs for the call center. Staffing based on SIPP became less accurate when the average service duration became longer or the arrival rate fluctuation was large, which often occurred in the morning and around lunch break.Originality/value - The CSS approach is based on the dynamic staffing proposed by Whitt. However, CSS extends the basic idea of dynamic staffing to combine a simulation experiment with a number of repetitions and the same run length of planning intervals. In a call center with shorter planning intervals, management should adopt staffing based on CSS for accurate planning and updating of staffing levels during a single planning horizon.",,,,,,,,,6,1,0,0,0,0,7,,,0263-5577,1758-5783,,,,,,,"Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Business Adm, Taegu, South KoreaKorea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Taejon 305701, South Korea",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000280935600005,,,atlason_et_al_2007

Academic/practical relevance: Since algorithms are widely adopted by businesses and often require human involvement, understanding how humans perceive algorithms is instrumental to the success of algorithm design in operations. Particularly, the growing concern that algorithms may reproduce inequality historically exhibited by humans calls for research about how people perceive the fairness of algorithmic decision making (relative to traditional human-based decision making) and, consequently, adjust their work behaviors. Methodology: In a 15-day-long field experiment with Alibaba Group in a warehouse where workers pick products following orders (or pick lists), we randomly assigned half of the workers to receive pick lists from a machine that ostensibly relied on an algorithm to distribute pick lists, and the other half to receive pick lists from a human distributor. Results: Despite that we used the same underlying rule to assign pick lists in both groups, workers perceive the algorithmic (versus human-based) assignment process as fairer by 0.94-1.02 standard deviations. This yields productivity benefits: receiving tasks from an algorithm (versus a human) increases workers' picking efficiency by 15.56%-17.86%. These findings persist beyond the first day when workers were involved in the experiment, suggesting that our results are not limited to the initial phrase when workers might find algorithmic assignment novel. We replicate the main results in another field experiment involving a nonoverlapping sample of warehouse workers. We also show via online experiments that people in the United States also view algorithmic task assignment as fairer than human-based task assignment. Managerial implications: We demonstrate that algorithms can have broader impacts beyond offering greater efficiency and accuracy than humans: introducing algorithmic assignment processes may enhance fairness perceptions and productivity.

Academic/practical relevance: Although recent studies suggest that increasing schedule predictability by reducing just-in-time scheduling can increase productivity, few have examined the effects of schedule consistency on worker productivity. Our study fills this void by investigating the impact of schedule consistency on cashier productivity in grocery retailing. Methodology: We estimate econometric models using transaction level scanner data including more than 1.2 million shopping baskets processed by 126 cashiers working for a local grocer. Work schedule consistency is operationalized via two metrics: (1) hour-of-the-day consistency measuring whether a cashier is consistently scheduled to work in the same hours of the day, and (2) day-of-the-week consistency measuring whether a cashier is consistently scheduled to work on the same days of the week. Results: We find that, on average, hour-of-the-day consistency and day-of-the-week consistency increase cashier productivity by 0.95% and 1.63%, respectively. These effects aremuch stronger for inexperienced cashiers (e.g., an average productivity boost of 3.39% and 7.93%, respectively, for the new hires).

Investigating such an effect is important because past findings on the effects of subcontracting in retail or assembly lines cannot be hastily extrapolated to the more qualified workers and more demanding tasks normally associated with project environments. Methodology: Building on previous findings about the higher motivation level of subcontracted versus permanent workers when the latter are protected from individual dismissal by the law, we develop hypotheses to conceptualize how and under what conditions subcontracted workers positively impact project performance. We then test our hypotheses by analyzing 413 projects of a European high-tech firm. Results: We find that with increased use of subcontracted workers comes increased project profit margins. This positive effect is stronger for larger teams and weaker when large project scope changes occur or when higher-skilled workers are subcontracted. We also find this effect to be stronger when subcontracted workers are involved in technical rather than administrative roles and when subcontractors join in the later stages of the project.

Although effective in reducing staffing level, hence labor cost, the potential impact of just-in-time scheduling on workers' productivity and the firm's revenue is not well understood. Using a data set of 1,444,044 transactions from 25 stores of a full-service casual dining restaurant chain in the United States, we study how just-in-time scheduling impacts worker productivity. We consider two types of just-in-time schedules: (1) short-notice schedules that are assigned to servers shortly before the day of service (mostly two days in our data) and (2) real-time schedules that are assigned to servers on the day of service. We show that short-notice schedules do not harm server productivity overall, but real-time schedules do by 4.4%. Our analysis indicates this may be because servers reduce their up-selling and cross-selling efforts when working on real-time schedules. We then propose an analytical scheduling model that accounts for both the value of staffing flexibility created through just-in-time scheduling and its impact on server productivity to inform the firm how to use just-in-time scheduling to improve profitability. Through a case study, we demonstrate that with the 4.4% productivity loss during the real-time schedules, the managers should shift from the heavy use of real-time scheduling toward scheduling more servers with longer advance notice. Such a shift not only provides more predictable work schedules for the workers but can also improve restaurants' expected profit by up to 1%, a significant number for the low-margin restaurant industry.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,0025-1909,1526-5501,,,,,,,"Univ Miami, Miami Herbert Business Sch, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USAGeorgia Inst Technol, Scheller Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30308 USAUniv Washington, Foster Sch Business, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,,,2021-11-26,WOS:000719120400007,,,bhandari_et_al_2008

We derive its fluid approximation; a system of ordinary linear differential equations with continuous, piecewise smooth, right-hand sides. Based on the fluid model, we propose a novel approach to determine optimal stationary staffing levels for new and returning customer queues in anticipation of future time-varying dynamics.

In a numerical study, we demonstrate that our approach creates staffing policies that maximize throughput while balancing acquisition and retention efforts more effectively (i.e., equitable abandonment from each customer class) than commonly used near-stationary methods such as variants of square-root staffing policies.

We propose a flexible policy to provide optimal actions according to the reward considering future requests and vehicle availability.

We construct models for profit and cost centers using dynamic rate queues. To allow for practical optimal controls, we approximate the queueing process using a Gaussian random variable with equal mean and variance. We then appeal to the Pontryagin's maximum principle to derive a closed form square root staffing (SRS) rule for optimal staffing. Unlike most traditional SRS formulas, the main parameter in our formula is not the probability of delay but rather a cost-to-benefit ratio that depends on the shadow price. We show that the delay experienced by customers can be interpreted in terms of this ratio. Throughout the article, we provide theoretical support of our analysis and conduct extensive numerical experiments to reinforce our findings. To this end, various scenarios are considered to evaluate the change in the staffing levels as the cost-to-benefit ratio changes. We also assess the change in the service grade and the effects of a service-level agreement constraint. Our analysis indicates that the variation in the ratio of customer abandonment over service rate particularly influences staffing levels and can lead to drastically different policies between profit and cost service centers.

Remarkably, LBLR yields the globally optimal cost in each of more than 22,500 instances of the general problem, outperforming SBSR and FBFR with respect to both objective value (by up to 2.6% and 4.8%, respectively) and computation time (by up to three orders and one order of magnitude, respectively) in 350 of these instances (those on which we compare the heuristics). LBLR and SBSR perform significantly better than FBFR when replenishment batch sizes imperfectly match the component requirements of the most valuable or most highly demanded product. In addition, LBLR substantially outperforms SBSR if it is crucial to hold a significant amount of inventory that must be rationed.",,,,,,,,,8,3,0,0,0,0,11,,,1059-1478,1937-5956,,,,,,,"Bilkent Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-06800 Ankara, TurkeyCarnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",,,,2016-04-27,WOS:000373946100004,,,bhandari_et_al_2008

We propose a simple inventory replenishment and allocation heuristic to minimize the expected total cost over an infinite time horizon. In our heuristic, inventory of the newest items is replenished in fixed quantities and the newest items are protected for future use by limiting some substitutions when making allocation decisions according to a critical-level policy. We model our problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), derive the costs of our heuristic policy, and computationally compare this policy to extant near optimal policies in the literature.

This paper was intended to provide an updated review on how OR has been applied in the service sector in recent years and what directions the study of OR will be carried forward in the near future. Under a proposed research framework, recent OR-related articles were collected from 17 leading OR journals and classified into the five most active sectors, that is, transportation and warehousing, information and communication, human health and social assistance, retails and wholesales, and financial and insurance services. The conclusions on the limitations of existing studies and the demanding ORs in the service have been drawn from our summaries and observations from a comprehensive review in this field.

To achieve substantial quality improvement, managers need to obtain in-depth information from operational metrics such as first call resolution (FCR). This research incorporated rough set theory (RST) in analyzing FCR to produce decision rules. RST has been known to reduce the number of attributes and attribute values without affecting the original results. Data from a tariff (industry segment) call center in Taiwan were used in this study, and a four-step process was used to produce the final decision rules. The results were verified by a 10-fold cross-validation process against the decision rules produced without applying RST. The decision rules produced with RST are as effective as those produced without, but with reduced number of attributes and attribute values. This reduced decision rule set can help managers analyze the current operator procedures more efficiently and subsequently improve the call center efficiency. Without affecting effectiveness, the RST application reduces the needed number of attributes and attribute values to produce a more compact decision rule set, and this increased efficiency, in turn, allows managers to delve deeper into the operational factors.

Customer waiting times can be short, with a majority of customers served immediately upon arrival, while server utilizations remain close to 100%. However, we show that this confluence of quality and efficiency is not achieved without risk, because there can be severe congestion if the system does not operate as planned. In particular, we show that the large scale makes the system more vulnerable to service interruptions when (i) most customers remain waiting until they can be served, and (ii) when many servers are unable to function during the interruption, as may occur with a system-wide computer failure. Increasing scale leads to higher server utilizations, which in turn leads to longer recovery times from service interruptions and worse performance during such events.

Two thresholds, one for each direction of sharing, automatically detect the overload condition and prevent undesired sharing under normal loads. After a threshold has been exceeded, the control aims to keep the ratio of the two queue lengths at a specified value. To gain insight, we introduce an idealized stochastic model with two customer classes and two associated service pools containing large numbers of agents.

In particular, this paper focuses on a class of resource allocation problems where the service-level objective and constraints are in the form of probabilistic measures. Further, process complexity and system dynamics in service systems often render their performance evaluation and optimization challenging and relying on simulation models. To this end, we propose a generalized resource allocation model with probabilistic measures, and subsequently, develop an optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) formulation to select the optimal solution subject to random noises in simulation. The OCBA formulation minimizes the expected opportunity cost that penalizes based on the quality of the selected solution. Further, the formulation takes a Bayesian approach to consider the prior knowledge and potential performance correlations on candidate solutions.

The SSP is often difficult to solve to optimality in practice for its complex structure. In this paper, a two-stage approach is proposed to tackle the problem, where the former generates preliminary solutions satisfying all the hard constraints, and the latter refines the solutions by fulfilling soft constraints as much as possible. The proposed approach employs artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm as the main search framework in both stages, and appropriate neighborhood structures are designed respectively. Specifically, in the latter stage, integer programming (IP) employed under several ruin-and-recreate principles is embedded in the ABC algorithm, which helps intensify and diversify solutions. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in achieving good solutions for large-scale problem in-stances.

The objective is to find a minimal cost staffing solution while meeting a target level for the quality of service (QoS) to customers. We consider a staffing problem in which joint chance constraints are imposed on the QoS of the day. Our joint chance-constrained formulation is more rational capturing the correlation between different call types, as compared to separate chance-constrained versions considered in previous studies. We show that, in general, the probability functions in the joint-chance constraints display S-shaped curves, and the optimal solutions should belong to the concave regions of the curves. Thus, we propose an approach combining a heuristic phase to identify solutions lying in the concave part and a simulation-based cut generation phase to create outer-approximations of the probability functions. This allows us to find good staffing solutions satisfying the joint-chance constraints by simulation and linear programming. We test our formulation and algorithm using call center examples of up to 65 call types and 89 agent groups, which shows the benefits of our joint-chance constrained formulation and the advantage of our algorithm over standard ones.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1382-6905,1573-2886,,,,,,,"Phenikaa Univ, Fac Comp Sci, ORLab, Hanoi, VietnamSingapore Management Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Syst, Singapore, Singapore",Phenikaa Univ,,,2022-01-13,WOS:000740209900001,,,cezik_l_cuyer_2008

In the present paper, we focus on a customer service representative scheduling problem considering the stochastic customer arrival time and service duration to minimise the total cost including two parts: (i) the loss concerning the customer waiting and (ii) cost of providing service representatives. We formulate this scheduling problem as an integer programming problem and employ an adapted water wave optimization (WWO) algorithm to solve this problem efficiently.

Design/methodology/approach This study is based on an integrative synthesis of 94 published peer-reviewed empirical and non-empirical articles on the use of quantification in HRM. It uses the theoretical framework of the sociology of quantification. Findings The analysis shows that there have been several changes in HRM quantification over 2000-2020 in terms of data sources, methods and objectives. Meanwhile, representations of quantification have evolved relatively little; it is still considered as a tool, and this ignores the possible conflicts and subjectivity associated with the use of quantification.

In a second stage, more accurate forecasts are obtained and the staffing may have to be modified at a cost, to meet the constraints. This leads to a challenging two-stage stochastic optimization problem in which the quantities involved in the (nonlinear) constraints can only be estimated via simulation, so several independent simulations are required for each first-level scenario.

We argue that live chat can increase online sales conversion by performing the functions of informing and persuading. We explore how the two roles of live chat interact with existing information regarding sellers and their products, such as product descriptions, ratings, price, and reviews, as these types of information also influence consumers' perceived product quality and help mitigate uncertainties in product fit to their needs. We apply a random-coefficient model in a Bayesian hierarchical framework and test the model using a panel dataset from Taobao, the leading C2C platform in China. Our results suggest that live chat has a positive impact on conversion and that the strength of this positive effect depends on seller and product characteristics. The positive effect is stronger when product information on web pages is less comprehensive (where live chat manifests an informative role), and when the perceived value of the product is higher (where live chat manifests a persuasive role) with either a higher product rating or a lower product price.

We study asample average approximation(SAA) approach that uses nested sampling, in which at each stage, a number of scenarios are examined and a number of simulation replications are performed for each scenario to estimate the next-stage constraints. This approach provides an approximate solution to the multistage problem. To establish the consistency of the SAA approach, we first consider a two-stage problem and show that in the second-stage problem, given a scenario, the optimal values and solutions of the SAA converge to those of the true problem with probability one when the sample sizes go to infinity. These convergence results do not hold uniformly over all possible scenarios for the second stage problem. We are nevertheless able to prove that the optimal values and solutions of the SAA converge to the true ones with probability one when the sample sizes at both stages increase to infinity. We also prove exponential convergence of the probability of a large deviation for the optimal value of the SAA, the true value of an optimal solution of the SAA, and the probability that any optimal solution to the SAA is an optimal solution of the true problem. All of these results can be extended to a multistage setting and we explain how to do it. Our framework and SAA results cover a large variety of resource allocation problems for which at each stage after the first one, new information becomes available and the allocation can be readjusted, under constraints that involve expectations estimated by Monte Carlo. As an illustration, we apply this SAA method to a staffing problem in a call center, in which the goal is to optimize the numbers of agents of each type under some constraints on the quality of service (QoS).

They are strategic tools to establish a relationship with customers to promote customer satisfaction, which can lead to an increase in customer loyalty and sales. One important factor impacting customer satisfaction is service reliability, which should be constantly monitored to enhance customer satisfaction. This paper uses a systems thinking approach to investigate contact centers from a systems perspective. We aim to provide a holistic view of the customer support process to help decision makers infer transformations in the system. We present an architecture of the contact center operations management system incorporating concepts of systems engineering, and describe its components and functions. The systems perspective to contact center processes facilitates developing a customer service reliability model.

In this paper, we describe a simulation-optimization method for fare-collection shift scheduling in a subway network. We use an integer programming model to generate shift schedules and a discrete-event simulation model to evaluate the corresponding service levels in terms of the average number of users waiting in line over time. If the expected service level at a particular station booth does not meet a predefined service standard, then our method automatically generates an additional constraint on the number of fare collectors at that station booth. The proposed approach iteratively adds this new constraint to the integer programming model until either the current schedule meets the service standard or the problem becomes infeasible.

For the rostering problem both integer programming and constraint programming models are developed to determine assignments of operators to all shifts, weekly days-off, and meal and relief break times of the operators.

Following standard practice, the day is divided into time periods of equal length (e.g., 15 or 30 minutes), the arrival rate is assumed random but constant in time in each period, and the arrivals are from a Poisson process, conditional on the rate. The random rate for each period is taken as a deterministic base rate (or expected rate) multiplied by a random busyness factor having mean 1. Models in which the busyness factors are independent across periods, or in which a common busyness factor applies to all periods, have been studied previously. But they are not sufficiently realistic. We examine alternative models for which the busyness factors have some form of dependence across periods. Maximum likelihood parameter estimation for these models is not easy, mainly because the arrival rates themselves are never observed. We develop specialized techniques to perform this estimation. We compare the goodness-of-fit of these models on arrival data from three call centers, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Our models can represent arrivals in many other types of systems as well. Estimating a model for the vector of counts (the number of arrivals in each period) is generally easier than for the vector of rates, because the counts can be observed, but a model for the rates is often more convenient and natural, e.g., for simulation. We examine and provide insight on the relationship between these two types of modeling. In particular, we give explicit formulas for the relationship between the correlation between rates and that between counts in two given periods, and for the variance and dispersion index in a given period. These formulas imply that for a given correlation between the rates, the correlation between the counts is much smaller in low traffic than in high traffic.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,0030-364X,,,,,,,,"Univ Montreal, Dept Informat & Rech Operat, Pavillon Aisenstadt, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",,,,2016-05-25,WOS:000375603700018,,,cezik_l_cuyer_2008

Shared norms and attitudes concerning knowledge, IT use, and responsibility for different call types within teams were associated with redirecting practices which lead to the problematic rerouting of calls. Problems with call routing and rerouting negatively affected operational efficiency and undermined customer satisfaction.Research limitations/implications - The paper is based upon a single case study so further research is required to examine how problems identified are manifest in call centre operations of different size and complexity. The qualitative approach develops rich insights but these findings would benefit from a quantitative focus in the future.Practical implications - The customer experience of IVR systems should be continually monitored to identify usability problems and ensure effective design, while call centre management should attempt to increase teams' awareness of and ability to successfully redirect incorrectly routed calls.Originality/value - The paper conceptualises the mutual influence of macro-level service system design and the micro-level behaviour of customers and agents upon each other. In practice, formal design decisions such as input uncertainty, decoupling, and interdependence patterns are continually reproduced or modified. Shared attitudes and norms of teams and their behavioural influence upon agents' call handling practices are identified as a cause of coordination problems in call centres service systems. Internal rerouting by agents is also identified as a crucial operational process and important area for future research.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,,,0144-3577,1758-6593,,,,,,,"Univ Canberra, Fac Business Govt & Law, Canberra, ACT, Australia",,,,2016-08-03,WOS:000379677500003,,,cezik_l_cuyer_2008

In this research, the workforce scheduling model is developed for assigning tasks to multiskilled workforce by considering learning of knowledge and requirements of project quality. By using piecewise linearization to learning curve, the mixed 0-1 nonlinear programming model (MNLP) is transformed into a mixed 0-1 linear programming model (MLP). After that, the MLP model is further improved by taking account of the upper bound of employees' experiences accumulation, and the stable performance of mature employees.

Adapting the staffing levels in such systems is non-trivial due to large variations in workload and the large number of system parameters do not allow for a brute force search. Further, because these parameters change on a weekly basis, the optimization should not take longer than a few hours. Our aim is to find the optimum staffing levels from a discrete high-dimensional parameter set, that minimizes the long run average of the single-stage cost function, while adhering to the constraints relating to queue stability and service-level agreement (SLA) compliance. The single-stage cost function balances the conflicting objectives of utilizing workers better and attaining the target SLAs. We formulate this problem as a constrained parameterized Markov cost process parameterized by the (discrete) staffing levels. We propose novel simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA)-based algorithms for solving the above problem. The algorithms include both first-order as well as second-order methods and incorporate SPSA-based gradient/Hessian estimates for primal descent, while performing dual ascent for the Lagrange multipliers. Both algorithms are online and update the staffing levels in an incremental fashion. Further, they involve a certain generalized smooth projection operator, which is essential to project the continuous-valued worker parameter tuned by our algorithms onto the discrete set. The smoothness is necessary to ensure that the underlying transition dynamics of the constrained Markov cost process is itself smooth (as a function of the continuous-valued parameter): a critical requirement to prove the convergence of both algorithms. We validate our algorithms via performance simulations based on data from five real-life service systems. For the sake of comparison, we also implement a scatter search based algorithm using state-of-the-art optimization tool-kit OptQuest. From the experiments, we observe that both our algorithms converge empirically and consistently outperform OptQuest in most of the settings considered.

The data belonging to the performance criteria, which are determined, are obtained with the help of the running scenarios combining with the factor levels using Taguchi design. Then, signals to the noise (S/N) ratios are calculated for these which are obtained from the performance data. A decision matrix is generated with S/N ratios; the TOPSIS method is used to transfer the multi-response problems into the single-response problems.

To clarify future research directions of operations research (OR) in the service industry, the state of art of OR has been examined systematically, the new requirements of OR are identified for its applications in service industries in comparison with those in manufacturing industries, and the limitations of existing methodologies and tools have been discussed. This paper was intended to provide an updated review on how OR has been applied in the service sector in recent years and what directions the study of OR will be carried forward in the near future. Under a proposed research framework, recent OR-related articles were collected from 17 leading OR journals and classified into the five most active sectors, that is, transportation and warehousing, information and communication, human health and social assistance, retails and wholesales, and financial and insurance services. The conclusions on the limitations of existing studies and the demanding ORs in the service have been drawn from our summaries and observations from a comprehensive review in this field.

In a call center, where the call arrival rates tend to fluctuate during the day, the agent allocation plans are required to be planned flexibly and the number of operating call center agents ought to be updated whenever needed, in order to keep the customer satisfaction level over a predefined level. Workforce plans are usually generated by the use of queuing models that are based on Erlang C calculations. However, they have assumptions that oversimplify the real system and jeopardize the validation of the model. At this point, the simulation models, which do not have such restrictive assumptions, are effective in calculating the required number of agents for each time period and measuring the performance of a given shift schedule. In this study, a simulation-based decision support system (DSS) is developed that runs on real-time data for one of the largest call centers in Turkey. The graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are designed in accordance with the man-machine interaction consideration to increase the usability, functionality and effectiveness of the DSS.

The service providers employ a large workforce to service many clients, aiming to meet the service-level agreements (SLAs) and deliver a satisfactory client experience. A challenge is that the volumes of service requests change dynamically and the types of such requests are unique to each client. The task of adapting the staffing levels to the workloads in such systems while complying with aggregate SLA constraints is nontrivial. We formulate this problem as a constrained parametrized Markov process with a discrete parameter and propose two multi-timescale smoothed functional (SF)-based stochastic optimization SASOC (staff allocation using stochastic optimization with constraints) algorithms-SASOC-SF-N and SASOC-SF-C-for its solution. Whereas SASOC-SF-N uses a Gaussian-based smoothed functional approach, SASOC-SF-C uses the Cauchy smoothed functional algorithm for primal descent. Further, all SASOC algorithms incorporate a generalized projection operator that extends the system to a continuous setting with suitably defined transition probabilities. We validate these optimization schemes on five real-life service systems and compare their performance with a previous SASOC algorithm and the commercial optimization software OptQuest. Our algorithms are observed to be 25 times faster than OptQuest and have proven convergence guarantees to the optimal staffing levels, whereas OptQuest fails to find feasible solutions in some cases even under a reasonably high threshold on the number of search iterations. From the optimization experiments, we observe that our algorithms find better solutions than OptQuest in many cases, and among our algorithms, SASOC-SF-C performs marginally better than SASOC-SF-N.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,0,4,,,2164-3962,2164-3970,,,,,,,"Indian Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Automat, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, IndiaIBM Res India, Bangalore 560045, Karnataka, India",IBM Res India,,,2013-03-01,WOS:000209530800004,,,cezik_l_cuyer_2008

Conditional on the number of calls in a period, their arrival times are independent and uniformly distributed over the period. This type of model has the advantage of being simple and reasonably flexible, and can match the correlations between the arrival counts in different periods much better than previously proposed models. For the situation where the number of periods is large, so the number of correlations to estimate can be excessive, we propose simple parametric forms for the correlations, defined as functions of the time lag between the periods.

We prove existence and construction results for randomly shifted lattice rules such that the variance bounds are almost O(n(-alpha)), where n is the number of function evaluations and alpha > 1 depends on our assumptions on the convergence speed of the Fourier coefficients. These results hold for general weights, arbitrary n, and any dimension. With additional conditions on the weights, we obtain a convergence that holds uniformly in the dimension, and this provides sufficient conditions for strong tractability of the integration problem.

Density forecasts of arrival rates are needed for analytical call center models, which assume Poisson arrivals with a stochastic arrival rate. Density forecasts of call volumes can be used in simulation models and are also important for the analysis of outsourcing contracts. A forecasting method, which has previously shown strong potential, is Holt-Winters exponential smoothing adapted for modeling the intraday and intraweek cycles in intraday data. To enable density forecasting of the arrival volume and rate, we develop a Poisson count model, with gamma distributed arrival rate, which captures the essential features of this exponential smoothing method. The apparent stationary level in our data leads us to develop versions of the new model for series with stationary levels. We evaluate forecast accuracy up to two weeks ahead using data from three organizations. We find that the stationary level models improve prediction beyond approximately two days ahead, and that these models perform well in comparison with sophisticated benchmarks.

The paper aims to investigate the value of a time-dependent approach to determine staffing levels without making an assumption that call centers to be a queuing model in a steady state.Design/methodology/approach - Staffing is usually accomplished through the use of simple queuing models, Erlang-C (M/M/c). It is common to adopt a stationary independent period by period (SIPP) approach. However, staffing based on SIPP does not consider uncompleted calls and each planning interval cannot achieve a steady state in most cases, since the lengths of planning intervals are short in fact. In this context, the CSS approach considers uncompleted calls and determines staffing levels by using simulation.Findings - Staffing based on the CSS approach needed fewer agents, compared with staffing based on the SIPP approach. Hiring less agents during a single planning horizon lead to a decrease in total operational costs for the call center. Staffing based on SIPP became less accurate when the average service duration became longer or the arrival rate fluctuation was large, which often occurred in the morning and around lunch break.Originality/value - The CSS approach is based on the dynamic staffing proposed by Whitt. However, CSS extends the basic idea of dynamic staffing to combine a simulation experiment with a number of repetitions and the same run length of planning intervals. In a call center with shorter planning intervals, management should adopt staffing based on CSS for accurate planning and updating of staffing levels during a single planning horizon.",,,,,,,,,6,1,0,0,0,0,7,,,0263-5577,1758-5783,,,,,,,"Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Business Adm, Taegu, South KoreaKorea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Taejon 305701, South Korea",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000280935600005,,,cezik_l_cuyer_2008

Firstly, we demonstrate that the previously proposed policy definition is sub-optimal and cannot represent a set of solutions that are reasonable in practice, and propose an alternative definition. Secondly, we examine the problem of finding the optimal combination of cross-trained and specialized workers under a complete set of assumptions regarding worker costs. This analysis shows that the structure of the optimal solution depends on the policy definition that is employed. Moreover, under some assumptions the cost of the 'optimal' solution with the original policy definition will be greater than the cost of the optimal solution with the new one. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

An approximation of these service levels is developed that allows an arbitrary overflow mechanism and customer abandonment.

Because service level approximation errors may be substantial, the solution is adjusted in a second stage in which performance is estimated by simulation.

We empirically validate that the sinusoidal NHPP is consistent with arrival data from two settings of great interest in service operations: patient arrivals to an emergency department and customer calls to a bank call centre. This finding provides rigorous justification for the use of the sinusoidal NHPP assumption in many existing queuing models. We also clarify why a sinusoidal NHPP model is more suitable than the standard NHPP when the underlying arrival pattern is aperiodic (e.g., does not follow a weekly cycle). This is illustrated using data from a car dealership and also via a naturalistic staffing simulation based on the call centre. On the other hand, if the arrival pattern is periodic, we explain why both models should perform comparably.

They fear a rapid influx of patients overwhelming the healthcare system and leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and states in America have introduced mitigation strategies, such as using social distancing to decrease the rate of newly infected people. This is what is usually meant by flattening the curve. In this paper, we use queueing theoretic methods to analyze the time evolution of the number of people hospitalized due to the coronavirus. Given that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the theory of infinite server queues with time inhomogeneous Poisson arrival rates. With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how aggressive societal policy needs to be to avoid overwhelming the capacity of healthcare system.

Both are random and unobservable, affecting the spread of the disease, patient arrivals to health care units (HCUs) and the number of deaths. A novel, inventory perspective of COVID-19 is proposed, with random inflow, random losses and retrials (recurrent cases) and delayed/distributed exit, with randomly varying fractions of the exit distribution. A minimal construal, it enables representation of COVID-19 evolution with close fit of national incidence profiles, including single and multiple pattern outbreaks, oscillatory, periodic or non-periodic evolution, followed by retraction, leveling off, or strong resurgence. Furthermore, based on asymptotic laws, the minimum number of variables that must be monitored for identifying CaL and IR is determined and a real-time identification method is presented. The method is data-driven, utilizing the entry rate to HCUs and scaled, or dimensionless variables, including the mean residence time of symptomatic carriers in CaL and the mean residence time in CaL of patients entering HCUs. As manifested by several robust case studies of national COVID-19 incidence profiles, it provides efficient identification in real-time under unbiased monitoring error, without relying on any model. The propagation factor, a stochastic process, is reconstructed from the identified trajectories of CaL and IR, enabling evaluation of control measures. The results are useful towards the design of policies restricting COVID-19 and encumbrance to HCUs and mitigating economic contraction.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The queue is driven by an external arrival process and is subject to a time-varying service process that is a function of the SINR that it sees. Static configurations of interferers result in an infinite queue workload with positive probability. In contrast, a generic stability condition is established for the queue in the case where interferers possess any non-zero mobility that results in displacements that are both independent across interferers and oblivious to interferer positions. The proof leverages the mixing property of the Poisson point process. The effect of an increase in mobility on queuing metrics is also studied. Convex ordering tools are used to establish that faster moving interferers result in a queue workload that is smaller for the increasing-convex stochastic order. As a corollary, mean workload and mean delay decrease as network mobility increases. This stochastic ordering as a function of mobility is explained by establishing positive correlations between SINR level-crossing events at different time points, and by determining the autocorrelation function for interference and observing that it decreases with increasing mobility.

Especially in stochastic service systems, for example, in call centers, customers may leave the queue if their waiting time exceeds their personal patience. As discussed in the extant literature, it can be useful to use general distributions to model such customer patience. This paper analyzes the time-dependent performance of a multiserver queue with a nonhomogeneous Poisson arrival process with a time-dependent arrival rate, exponentially distributed processing times, and generally distributed time to abandon. Fast and accurate performance approximations are essential for decision support in such queueing systems, but the extant literature lacks appropriate methods for the setting we consider. To approximate time-dependent performance measures for small- and medium-sized systems, we develop a new stationary backlog-carryover (SBC) approach that allows for the analysis of underloaded and overloaded systems. Abandonments are considered in two steps of the algorithm: (i) in the approximation of the utilization as a reduced arrival stream and (ii) in the approximation of waiting-based performance measures with a stationary model for general abandonments. To improve the approximation quality, we discuss an adjustment to the interval lengths. We present a limit result that indicates convergence of the method for stationary parameters. The numerical study compares the approximation quality of different adjustments to the interval length. The new SBC approach is effective for instances with small numbers of time-dependent servers and gamma-distributed abandonment times with different coefficients of variation and for an empirical distribution of the abandonment times from real-world data obtained from a call center. A discrete-event simulation benchmark confirms that the SBC algorithm approximates the performance of the queueing system with abandonments very well for different parameter configurations.Summary of Contribution: The paper presents a fast and accurate numerical method to approximate the performance measures of a time-dependent queueing system with generally distributed abandonments. The presented stationary backlog carryover approach with abandonment combines algorithmic ideas with stationary queueing models for generally distributed abandonment times.

We derive its fluid approximation; a system of ordinary linear differential equations with continuous, piecewise smooth, right-hand sides. Based on the fluid model, we propose a novel approach to determine optimal stationary staffing levels for new and returning customer queues in anticipation of future time-varying dynamics. Using system accessibility as a proxy for service quality and staffing levels as a proxy for investment, we demonstrate how to apply our approach to two families of time-varying arrival functions motivated by real-world applications: an advertising campaign and a clinical setting. In a numerical study, we demonstrate that our approach creates staffing policies that maximize throughput while balancing acquisition and retention efforts more effectively (i.e., equitable abandonment from each customer class) than commonly used near-stationary methods such as variants of square-root staffing policies.

This will put increased pressure on hospitals which have had problems predicting PPE usage and sourcing its supply. To meet this challenge, we propose an approach to predict demand for PPE. Specifically, we model the admission of patients to a medical department using multiple independent M-t/G/infinity queues. Each queue represents a class of patients with similar treatment plans and hospital length-of-stay. By estimating the total workload of each class, we derive closed-form estimates for the expected amount of PPE required over a specified time horizon using current PPE guidelines. We apply our approach to a data set of 22,039 patients admitted to the general internal medicine department at St. Michael's hospital in Toronto, Canada from April 2010 to November 2019. We find that gloves and surgical masks represent approximately 90% of predicted PPE usage.

We tackle the problem under the efficiency-driven many-server heavy-traffic limiting regime, where both the demand volume and the number of servers grow proportionally to infinity.

For this purpose, we study a multiserver queueing system where customer arrivals follow a doubly stochastic Poisson point process whose intensities are driven by a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process. The nonnegativity and autoregressive feature of the CIR process makes it a good candidate for modeling temporary dips and surges in arrivals. First, we devise an effective statistical procedure to calibrate our new arrival model to data which can be seen as a specification of the celebrated expectation-maximization algorithm. Second, we establish functional limit theorems for the CIR process, which in turn facilitate the derivation of functional limit theorems for our queueing model under suitable heavy-traffic regimes. Third, using the corresponding heavy traffic limits, we asymptotically solve an optimal staffing problem subject to delay-based constraints on the service levels. We find that, in order to achieve the designated service level, such an autoregressive feature in the arrival model translates into notable adjustment in the staffing formula, and such an adjustment can be fully characterized by the parameters of our new arrival model. In this respect, the staffing formulas acknowledge the presence of autoregressive structure in arrivals.

The call arrival process can be an arbitrary point process, allowing uncertainty and temporary surges in the arrival rate, provided that the system is stable. When a customer arrives, the call center manager examines the system state and decides whether to offer the incoming customer the callback option. When the callback option is offered, the customer decides whether to accept the offer. The customer is routed to the offline queue (to be called back later) only if he is offered the callback option and accepts it. Otherwise, he is routed to the online queue. For each customer in the online queue, the call center manager incurs a waiting cost of h per time unit. Similarly, whenever she routes a customer to the offline queue (for a callback later), she incurs a one-time penalty of p. Initially, we allow complete foresight policies that look into the entire future. We show that a simple lookahead policy that looks into the future arrivals and service completion times for the next p / h time units and uses the current number of customers in the system who previously rejected a callback offer (but does not look into the accept/reject decisions of future customers) is pathwise optimal. Building on the insights gleaned from the optimal lookahead policies, we also propose a nonanticipating (and implementable) policy by interpreting the lookahead policy in the fluid model and show that it is optimal in the fluid model. In particular, we show that this policy reduces to the so-called line policy, if the arrival rate process follows a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process.

The improved genetic algorithm found solutions that obey the delay probability constraint more often. The proposed local search heuristic also finds feasible solutions with a much lower computational expense, especially under low arrival rates. Differently from a genetic algorithm, the local search heuristic does not rely on random choices. Furthermore, it finds one final solution from one initial solution, rather than from a population of solutions.

We test a matheuristic approach to this problem, accounting for both patient flow and staff scheduling restrictions. Using a continuous-time Markov chain, patient flow is modeled as a time-dependent queueing network where inhomogeneous behavior is evaluated using the uniformization method. Based on this modeling approach, we recursively evaluate and allocate staff to the system using integer linear programming until the waiting time targets are respected in all queues of the network. By comparing to discrete-event simulations of the associated system, we show that this approach is adequate for both modeling and optimizing the patient flow.

We propose a fluid approximation to estimate the possibility of announcing the mean delay distribution and the retrials in the system. This approximation method can overcome some of the computational issues involved with a continuous time Markov chain analysis. The fluid approximation is also validated that it can work well in overloaded systems by performing a comparison between the fluid model and the stochastic model with delay information, and by performing the other comparison between the fluid model and the simulation model. Through a numerical study, this paper demonstrates the significance of delay information in a call center with retrials. In particular, delay announcement is more important in the system with a high retrial probability. Thus, we show how a delay announcement greatly reduces customer reneging and thereby improves customer satisfaction.

In this model, customers that are referred from the first station to the second when the latter is saturated (blocked) are forced to wait in the first station while occupying a server there. The finite waiting room before the first station causes customer loss and, therefore, requires reflection analysis.

As call centers have become the primary contact point between patients and emergency service providers, the planning of the call center has become a key task for administrators.Objectives: The aim of this study is to apply a widely used operations management method, the news vendor model, for optimizing the capacity level in EMS call centers with a minimum cost in order to efficiently meet the calls arriving.Methods: Real-life data from a call center for ambulance services in a major city in Turkey was used. We propose using the news vendor model for optimizing this call center's capacity level based on the forecasts of periodic call volumes via basic methods. Results: Ambulance service call volumes vary during the day and weekday call profiles are different from weekends. By separating the analysis into weekdays and weekends and illustrating shorter time intervals within the days, call volume can be forecast. Taking not only the point forecast but also the variation of the forecast into account, the capacity level of each period can be planned in a cost-effective way.Conclusions: This paper provides a basis for operation planning strategies of ambulance services by reconsidering the uncertainties of demand. The news vendor model, which works well under parameter uncertainty, can be used in planning the capacities of health care services, especially when high service levels are required.

The arrival process is periodic Poisson. The service time of a customer has components in different time scales: length of stay (LOS) in days and departure time (h(dis)) in hours. This queueing system has been used to study patient flows from the emergency department (ED) to hospital inpatient wards. In that setting, the LOS of a patient is simply the number of days she spends in a ward, and her departure time h(dis) is the discharge hour on the day of her discharge.We develop a new analytical framework that can perform exact analysis on this novel queueing system. This framework has two steps: first analyze the midnight customer count process and obtain its stationary distribution, then analyze the time-dependent customer count process to compute various performance measures. We also develop approximation tools that can significantly reduce the computational time. In particular, via Stein's method, we derive explicit expressions to approximate the stationary distribution of the midnight count. We provide error bounds for these approximations and numerically demonstrate that they are remarkably accurate for systems with various sizes and load conditions. Our theoretical and numerical analysis have produced a number of insights that can be used to improve hospital inpatient flow management. We find that the LOS term affects the overnight wait caused by the mismatch between daily arrivals and discharges, whereas the h(dis) term affects the intraday wait caused by the nonsynchronization between the arrival and discharge time patterns. Thus, reducing LOS or increasing capacity can impact the daily average performance significantly; shifting the discharge timing to earlier times of a day can alleviate the peak congestion in the morning and mainly affects the time-dependent performance.",,,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,0,0,29,,,0030-364X,,,,,,,,"Cornell Univ, Sch Operat Res & Informat Engn, Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USAPurdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Operat Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000401729900013,,,feldman_et_al_2008

We construct models for profit and cost centers using dynamic rate queues. To allow for practical optimal controls, we approximate the queueing process using a Gaussian random variable with equal mean and variance. We then appeal to the Pontryagin's maximum principle to derive a closed form square root staffing (SRS) rule for optimal staffing. Unlike most traditional SRS formulas, the main parameter in our formula is not the probability of delay but rather a cost-to-benefit ratio that depends on the shadow price. We show that the delay experienced by customers can be interpreted in terms of this ratio. Throughout the article, we provide theoretical support of our analysis and conduct extensive numerical experiments to reinforce our findings. To this end, various scenarios are considered to evaluate the change in the staffing levels as the cost-to-benefit ratio changes. We also assess the change in the service grade and the effects of a service-level agreement constraint. Our analysis indicates that the variation in the ratio of customer abandonment over service rate particularly influences staffing levels and can lead to drastically different policies between profit and cost service centers.

We divide the day into discrete time intervals where a simulation based stochastic programming method is used to determine staffing levels. More specifically, we develop a model to select the optimal number of agents required for a given time interval by minimizing an expected cost function, which consists of agent and abandonment (opportunity) costs, while considering the service quality requirements such as the delay probability. The objective function as well as the constraints in our formulation are random variables. The novelty of our approach is to introduce a solution method for the staffing of an operation where all three system rates (arrival, service, and abandonment) are random variables.

Determining these staffing requirements is often not straightforward, particularly in systems where the arrival rate fluctuates over the day. We present a branch-and-bound approach to estimate optimal shift schedules in systems with nonstationary stochastic demand and service level constraints. The algorithm is intended for personnel planning in service systems with limited opening hours (such as small call centers, banks, and retail stores). Our computational experiments show that the algorithm is efficient in avoiding regions of the solution space that cannot contain the optimum; moreover, it requires only a limited number of evaluations to encounter the estimated optimum. The quality of the starting solution is not a decisive factor for the algorithm's performance. Finally, by benchmarking our algorithm against two state-of-the-art algorithms, we show that our algorithm is very competitive, as it succeeds in finding a high-quality solution fast (i.e., with a limited number of simulations required in the search phase).

Shared norms and attitudes concerning knowledge, IT use, and responsibility for different call types within teams were associated with redirecting practices which lead to the problematic rerouting of calls. Problems with call routing and rerouting negatively affected operational efficiency and undermined customer satisfaction.Research limitations/implications - The paper is based upon a single case study so further research is required to examine how problems identified are manifest in call centre operations of different size and complexity. The qualitative approach develops rich insights but these findings would benefit from a quantitative focus in the future.Practical implications - The customer experience of IVR systems should be continually monitored to identify usability problems and ensure effective design, while call centre management should attempt to increase teams' awareness of and ability to successfully redirect incorrectly routed calls.Originality/value - The paper conceptualises the mutual influence of macro-level service system design and the micro-level behaviour of customers and agents upon each other. In practice, formal design decisions such as input uncertainty, decoupling, and interdependence patterns are continually reproduced or modified. Shared attitudes and norms of teams and their behavioural influence upon agents' call handling practices are identified as a cause of coordination problems in call centres service systems.

To gain insights into reducing this waiting time, we study operations in the inpatient wards and their interface with the ED. We focus on understanding the effect of inpatient discharge policies and other operational policies on the time-of-day waiting time performance, such as the fraction of patients waiting longer than six hours in the ED before being admitted. Based on an empirical study at a Singaporean hospital, we propose a novel stochastic processing network with the following characteristics to model inpatient operations: (1) A patient's service time in the inpatient wards depends on that patient's admission and discharge times and length of stay. The service times capture a two-time-scale phenomenon and are not independent and identically distributed. (2) Pre- and post-allocation delays model the extra amount of waiting caused by secondary bottlenecks other than bed unavailability, such as nurse shortage. (3) Patients waiting for a bed can overflow to a nonprimary ward when the waiting time reaches a threshold, where the threshold is time dependent. We show, via simulation studies, that our model is able to capture the inpatient flow dynamics at hourly resolution and can evaluate the impact of operational policies on both the daily and time-of-day waiting time performance. In particular, our model predicts that implementing a hypothetical policy can eliminate excessive waiting for those patients who request beds in mornings. This policy incorporates the following components: a discharge distribution with the first discharge peak between 8 A.M. and 9 A.M. and 26% of patients discharging before noon, and constant-mean allocation delays throughout the day. The insights gained from our model can help hospital managers to choose among different policies to implement depending on the choice of objective, such as to reduce the peak waiting in the morning or to reduce daily waiting time statistics.",,,,,,,,,74,0,0,0,0,0,74,,,0025-1909,1526-5501,,,,,,,"Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USANatl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Dept Decis Sci, Singapore 119245, SingaporeCornell Univ, Sch Operat Res & Informat Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USAUniv Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R ChinaNatl Univ Singapore, NUS Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Singapore 119245, SingaporeNatl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Singapore 119245, SingaporeNatl Univ Singapore Hosp, Singapore 119074, Singapore",,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000372114300001,,,feldman_et_al_2008

Some of the calls are re-attempts after abandonments (redials), and some are re-attempts after connected calls (reconnects). The combination of redials and reconnects has not been considered when making staffing decisions, while not distinguishing them from the total calls will inevitably lead to under-or overestimation of call volumes, which results in improper and hence costly staffing decisions.Motivated by this, in this paper we study call centers where customers can abandon, and abandoned customers may redial, and when a customer finishes his conversation with an agent, he may reconnect. We use a fluid model to derive first order approximations for the number of customers in the redial and reconnect orbits in the heavy traffic. We show that the fluid limit of such a model is the unique solution to a system of three differential equations. Furthermore, we use the fluid limit to calculate the expected total arrival rate, which is then given as an input to the Erlang A formula for the purpose of calculating the service levels and abandonment probabilities. The performance of such a procedure is validated numerically in the case of both single intervals with constant parameters and multiple intervals with time-dependent parameters. The results demonstrate that this approximation method leads to accurate estimations for the service levels and the abandonment probabilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed overload control automatically activates sharing (sending some customers from one system to the other) once a ratio of the queue lengths in the two systems crosses an activation threshold (with ratio and activation threshold parameters for each direction). In this paper, we are primarily concerned with ensuring that the system recovers rapidly after the overload is over, either because (i) the two systems return to normal loading or (ii) the direction of the overload suddenly shifts in the opposite direction. To achieve rapid recovery, we introduce lower thresholds for the queue ratios, below which one-way sharing is released. As a basis for studying the complex dynamics, we develop a new six-dimensional fluid approximation for a system with time-varying arrival rates, extending a previous fluid approximation involving a stochastic averaging principle. We conduct simulations to confirm that the new algorithm is effective for predicting the system performance and choosing effective control parameters.

Using the quantified cost estimates, we then provide a simulation framework for evaluating various admission strategies' performance.

For a single queue, simulation experiments showed that the algorithm successfully stabilizes abandonment probabilities and expected delays over a wide range of Quality-of-Service (QoS) targets. A limit theorem showed that stable performance at fixed QoS targets is achieved asymptotically as the scale increases (by letting the arrival rate grow while holding the service and patience distributions fixed). Here we extend that limit theorem to a feed-forward queueing network. However, these fixed QoS targets provide low QoS as the scale increases. Hence, these limits primarily support the algorithm with a low QoS target. For a high QoS target, effectiveness depends on the NHPP property, but the departure process never is exactly an NHPP. Thus, we investigate when a departure process can be regarded as approximately an NHPP. We show that index of dispersion for counts is effective for determining when a departure process is approximately an NHPP in this setting.

Erlang-R helps answer questions such as how many servers (physicians/nurses) are required to achieve predetermined service levels. Formally, it is merely a two-station open queueing network, which, in a steady state, evolves like an Erlang-C (M/M/s) model. In time-varying environments, on the other hand, the situation differs: here one must account for the reentrant nature of service to avoid excessive staffing costs or undesirable service levels.

A prevalent one is the ability of humans to abandon their wait, for example while waiting to be answered by a telephone agent, waiting for a physician's checkup at an emergency department, or waiting for the completion of an internet transaction. Abandonments can be very costly, to either the service provider (a forgone profit) or the customer (deteriorating health after leaving without being seen by a doctor), and often to both. Practically, models that ignore abandonment can lead to either over- or under-staffing; and in well-balanced systems (e.g., well-managed telephone call centers), the fittest (needy) who survive and reach service are rewarded with surprisingly short delays. Theoretically, the phenomenon of abandonment is interesting and challenging, in the context of Queueing Theory and Science as well as beyond (e.g., Psychology). Last, but not least, queueing models with abandonment are more robust and numerically stable, when compared against their abandonment-ignorant analogues. For our relatively narrow purpose here, abandonment of customers, while queueing for service, is the operational manifestation of customer patience, perhaps impatience, or (im)patience for short. This (im)patience is the focus of the present paper. It is characterized via the distribution of the time that a customer is willing to wait, and its dynamics are characterized by the hazard-rate of that distribution. We start with a framework for comprehending impatience, distinguishing the times that a customer expects to wait, is required to wait (offered wait), is willing to wait (patience time), actually waits and felt waiting. We describe statistical methods that are used to infer the (im)patience time and offered wait distributions. Then some useful queueing models, as well as their asymptotic approximations, are discussed. In the main part of the paper, we discuss several data-based pictures of impatience. Each picture is associated with an important phenomenon. Some theoretical and practical problems that arise from these phenomena, and existing models and methodologies that address these problems, are outlined. The problems discussed cover statistical estimation of impatience, behavior of overloaded systems, dependence between patience and service time, and validation of queueing models. We also illustrate how impatience changes across customers (e.g., VIP vs. regular customers), during waiting (e.g., in response to announcements) and through phases of service (e.g., after experiencing the answering machine over the phone).

Here it is shown that the bias in that indirect estimator can be estimated and reduced by applying the time-varying Little's law (TVLL). If there is appropriate time-varying staffing, then the waiting time distribution may not be time-varying even though the arrival rate is time varying. Given a fixed waiting time distribution with unknown mean, there is a unique mean consistent with the TVLL for each time t. Thus, under that condition, the TVLL provides an estimator for the unknown mean wait, given estimates of the average number in system over a subinterval and the arrival rate function. Useful variants of the TVLL estimator are obtained by fitting a linear or quadratic function to arrival data. When the arrival rate function is approximately linear (quadratic), the mean waiting time satisfies a quadratic (cubic) equation. The new estimator based on the TVLL is a positive real root of that equation.

This limit shows that the number of customers in the system at any time is approximately Gaussian, where the time-varying mean is unaffected by the dependence, but the time-varying variance is affected by the dependence. As a consequence, required staffing to meet customary quality-of-service targets in a large-scale service system with finitely many servers based on a normal approximation is primarily affected by dependence among the service times through this time-varying variance. This paper develops formulas and algorithms to quantify the impact of the dependence among the service times on that variance.

These staffing requirements populate a quadratic programming model for determining the distribution of agent tours that will maximize the fraction of offered calls beginning service within a target response time, subject to side constraints on tour type quantities.

The paper aims to investigate the value of a time-dependent approach to determine staffing levels without making an assumption that call centers to be a queuing model in a steady state.Design/methodology/approach - Staffing is usually accomplished through the use of simple queuing models, Erlang-C (M/M/c). It is common to adopt a stationary independent period by period (SIPP) approach. However, staffing based on SIPP does not consider uncompleted calls and each planning interval cannot achieve a steady state in most cases, since the lengths of planning intervals are short in fact. In this context, the CSS approach considers uncompleted calls and determines staffing levels by using simulation.Findings - Staffing based on the CSS approach needed fewer agents, compared with staffing based on the SIPP approach. Hiring less agents during a single planning horizon lead to a decrease in total operational costs for the call center.

Implementing this staffing rule requires that the forecasted values of the arrival counts and average service times maintain certain levels of precision.

If the rate at which customers balk and renege is an increasing, concave function of the number of customers in the system (head count), then the head-count process and the expected rate of lost sales are decreasing and convex in the capacity (service rate or number of servers). This result applies when customers cannot observe the head count, so that the balking probability is zero and the reneging rate increases linearly with the head count. Then the optimal capacity increases with the customer arrival rate but is not monotonic in the reneging rate per customer. When capacity is expensive or the reneging rate is high, the optimal capacity decreases with any further increase in the reneging rate. Therefore, managers must understand customers' impatience to avoid building too much capacity, but customers have an incentive to conceal their impatience, to avoid a degradation in service quality. If the system manager can prevent customers from reneging during service (by requiring advance payment or training employees to establish rapport with customers), the system's convexity properties are qualitatively different, but its comparative statics remain the same. Most important, the prevention of reneging during service can substantially reduce the total expected cost of lost sales and capacity.

A call center is modelled as an M/M/n+G queue, which is characterized by Poisson arrivals, exponential service times, n servers, and generally distributed patience times of customers. Our asymptotic analysis is performed as the arrival rate, and hence the number of servers n, increases indefinitely.We consider a constraint satisfaction problem, where one chooses the minimal staffing level n that adheres to a given cost constraint. The cost can incorporate the fraction abandoning, average wait, and tail probabilities of wait. Depending on the cost, several operational regimes arise as asymptotically optimal: Efficiency-Driven (ED), Quality and Efficiency-Driven (QED), and also a new ED+QED operational regime that enables QED tuning of the ED regime. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, over a wide range of system parameters, our approximations provide useful insight as well as excellent fit to exact optimal solutions. It turns out that the QED regime is preferable either for small-to-moderate call centers or for large call centers with relatively tight performance constraints. The other two regimes are more appropriate for large call centers with loose constraints.We consider two versions of the constraint satisfaction problem. The first one is constraint satisfaction on a single time interval, say one hour, which is common in practice. Of special interest is a constraint on the tail probability, in which case our new ED+QED staffing turns out asymptotically optimal. We also address a global constraint problem, say over a full day. Here several time intervals, say 24 hours, are considered, with interval-dependent staffing levels allowed; one seeks to minimize staffing levels, or more generally costs, given the overall performance constraint. In this case, there is the added flexibility of trading service levels among time intervals, but we demonstrate that only little gain is associated with this flexibility if one is concerned with the fraction abandoning.",,,,,,,,,74,4,0,0,0,3,80,,,0030-364X,,,,,,,,"Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, IsraelIBM Res Corp, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",,,,2009-09-01,WOS:000270866000012,,,feldman_et_al_2008

However, we show that this confluence of quality and efficiency is not achieved without risk, because there can be severe congestion if the system does not operate as planned. In particular, we show that the large scale makes the system more vulnerable to service interruptions when (i) most customers remain waiting until they can be served, and (ii) when many servers are unable to function during the interruption, as may occur with a system-wide computer failure. Increasing scale leads to higher server utilizations, which in turn leads to longer recovery times from service interruptions and worse performance during such events.

Despite its conceptual elegance, the operationalization of this process is challenging due to the various sources of randomness involved. The purpose of this paper is to help call centers enhance service levels while keeping operating expenses low by taking advantage of an on-call pool of temporary agents in day-to-day operations. For that purpose, we develop a two-stage decision model in which the first stage seeks the optimal mix of permanent and on-call staff, and the second stage seeks a joint on-demand staffing and call scheduling policy to minimize the associated cost given the base staffing level and the size of the on-call pool. Because the exact analysis of the two-stage decision model seems analytically intractable, we resort to an approximation in a suitable asymptotic regime. In that regime, we characterize the system dynamics of the service operation and derive an optimal joint on-demand staffing and call scheduling policy for the second-stage problem, which in turn is used to find an approximate solution to the first-stage problem. In particular, the derived policy for the second stage problem involves tapping into the on-call pool to procure a team of on-demand agents when the number of calls to be processed exceeds a certain threshold and dismissing them when it falls below another threshold; additionally, the call scheduling rule shows an unusual pattern due to the interplay between staffing and scheduling decisions.

Innovative marketplaces facilitate task discretion and seek novel and beneficial implementations in the platform design.

We model different working environments and server preferences via different distributions and study how the agents' preferences, task costs, and flexibility fee affect the equilibrium assignment.

Business owners are concerned that the resultant loss of scheduling flexibility could reduce overall operational efficiency. We argue this is not necessarily the case. Academic/practical relevance: Although recent studies suggest that increasing schedule predictability by reducing just-in-time scheduling can increase productivity, few have examined the effects of schedule consistency on worker productivity. Our study fills this void by investigating the impact of schedule consistency on cashier productivity in grocery retailing. Methodology: We estimate econometric models using transaction level scanner data including more than 1.2 million shopping baskets processed by 126 cashiers working for a local grocer. Work schedule consistency is operationalized via two metrics: (1) hour-of-the-day consistency measuring whether a cashier is consistently scheduled to work in the same hours of the day, and (2) day-of-the-week consistency measuring whether a cashier is consistently scheduled to work on the same days of the week. Results: We find that, on average, hour-of-the-day consistency and day-of-the-week consistency increase cashier productivity by 0.95% and 1.63%, respectively. These effects aremuch stronger for inexperienced cashiers (e.g., an average productivity boost of 3.39% and 7.93%, respectively, for the new hires). Managerial implications: Our findings suggest that (a) business owners can increase shift workers' productivity by providing them with more consistent work schedules, and (b) the productivity of less-experienced shift workers, especially new hires, is more vulnerable to inconsistent work schedules, highlighting the potential for operational efficiency gains from greater schedule consistency, especially for businesses employing a high portion of inexperienced shift workers.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1523-4614,1526-5498,,,,,,,"Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USAUniv Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Mkt Dept, Austin, TX 78705 USALehigh Univ, Coll Business, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA",,,,2022-08-09,WOS:000834008500001,,,gurvich_et_al_2008

In particular, one of the customer classes is considered urgent, and is therefore prioritized over the other class; further, the average service time of customers from the urgent class is significantly larger than that of the nonurgent class. We therefore refer to the urgent class as slow, and to the nonurgent class as fast. Due to the complexity and intractability of the system's dynamics, our goal is to develop and analyze an asymptotic approximation, which captures the prevalent fact that, in practice, customers from both classes are likely to experience delays before entering service. However, under existing many-server limiting regimes, only two of the following options can be captured in the limit: (i) either the customers from the prioritized (slow) customer class do not wait at all, or (ii) the fast-class customers do not receive any service. We therefore propose a novel Fluid-Diffusion Hybrid (FDH) many-server asymptotic regime, under which the queue of the slow class behaves like a diffusion limit, whereas the queue of the fast class evolves as a (random) fluid limit that is driven by the diffusion process. That FDH limit is achieved by assuming that the service rate of the fast class scales with the system's size, whereas the service rate of the slow class is kept fixed. Numerical examples demonstrate that our FDH limit is accurate when the difference between the service rates of the two classes is sufficiently large. We then employ the FDH approximation to study the costs and benefits of de-pooling the service pool, by reserving a small number of servers for the fast class.

Our objective is to devise proper staffing and scheduling schemes to achieve differentiated services for each class. Formally, for a class-specific delay target w(i) > 0 and threshold alpha(i) is an element of (0,1), we concurrently determine an appropriate staffing level (number of servers) and a server-assignment rule (assigning newly idle servers to a waiting customer from one of the classes), under which the percentage of class-i customers waiting more than wi does not exceed alpha(i). We tackle the problem under the efficiency-driven many-server heavy-traffic limiting regime, where both the demand volume and the number of servers grow proportionally to infinity. Our main findings are as follows: (a) class-level service differentiation is obtained by using a delay-based dynamic prioritization scheme; (b) the proposed scheduling rule achieves an important state-space collapse, in which all waiting time processes evolve as fixed proportions of a one-dimensional state-descriptor called the frontier process; (c) the frontier process solves a stochastic Volterra equation and is thus a non-Markovian process; (d) the proposed staffing-and-scheduling solution can be readily extended to time-varying settings.

This creates two important questions for service design. First, how important is it to maintain the continuity of service for individuals? Second, because maintaining continuity is costly and, at times, operationally impractical for both the organization (because of potentially lower utilization) and providers (because of high effort required), should certain customer types, such as those with complex needs, be prioritized for continuity? These questions are particularly important in healthcare services where patients with chronic conditions visit primary care offices repeatedly. Therefore, we explore these questions in the context of diabetes, a chronic disease. Academic/practical relevance: Although the operations management (OM) and healthcare literatures suggest that higher continuity is better for health outcomes, the possibility that one could have too much continuity has not been explored. We draw on literature on continuity of care from the healthcare literature and learning effects from the OM literature to theorize and then show a curvilinear relationship. In addition, we further the literature on continuity by examining different categories for prioritization. Methodology: We use a detailed and comprehensive data set from the Veterans Health Administration, the largest integrated healthcare delivery system in the United States, which permits us to control for potential sources of heterogeneity. We analyze over 300,000 patients over an 11-year period who suffer from diabetes, a chronic disease whose successful management requires continuity of care, as well as kidney disease, a major complication of diabetes. We use an empirical approach to quantify the relationship between continuity of care and three important health outcomes: inpatient visits, length of stay, and readmission rate. We conduct extensive robustness checks and sensitivity analyses to validate our findings. Results: We find that continuity of care is related to improvements in all three health outcomes. Moreover, we find that the gains are not linearly improving in continuity, but rather the relationship is curvilinear, whereby outcomes improve and then decline in increasing continuity of care, suggesting that there may be value in having multiple providers. Additionally, we find that continuity of care is even more important for patients suffering from more complex conditions. Managerial implications: Identifying the amount of continuity of care to provide and determining which individuals to prioritize are both of interest to practitioners and policymakers because they can help in designing appropriate policies for staffing and work allocation.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,12,,,1523-4614,1526-5498,,,,,,,"Southern Methodist Univ, Cox Sch Business, Dallas, TX 75275 USATexas Tech Univ, Dept Pharm Practice, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dallas, TX 75235 USAUniv N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",,,,2020-09-01,WOS:000565809100013,,,gurvich_et_al_2008

One common way this occurs is when servers are hierarchical in their skills or in the level of service they can provide. Much of the literature studying such systems relies on an understanding of the relative costs and benefits associated with serving different customer types by the different levels of service. In this work, we focus on estimating these costs and benefits in a complex healthcare setting where the major differentiation among server types is the intensity of service provided. Step-down units (SDUs) were initially introduced in hospitals to provide an intermediate level of care for semicritically ill patients who are not sick enough to require intensive care but not stable enough to be treated in the general medical/surgical ward. One complicating factor is that the needs of customers is sometimes uncertain-specifically, it is difficult to know a priori which level of care a particular patient needs. Using data from 10 hospitals from a single hospital network, we take a data-driven approach to classify patients based on severity and empirically estimate the clinical and operational outcomes associated with routing these patients to the SDU. Our findings suggest that an SDU may be a cost-effective way to treat patients when used for patients who are post-ICU (intensive care unit). However, the impact of SDU care is more nuanced for patients admitted from the emergency department and may result in increased mortality risk and hospital length of stay for patients who should be treated in the ICU.

In such systems, customers typically hang up and abandon the system if their wait for service is too long. Such abandonments are detrimental for the system, and so managers typically use scheduling as a tool to mitigate it. In this paper, we study the interplay between customer impatience and scheduling decisions when managing heterogeneous customer classes. Academic/practical relevance: Call centers constitute a large industry that has a global spending of around $300 billion and employs more than 15 million people worldwide. Our work focuses on improving call center operations, which can reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction. Mathematically, customer patience is typically modeled as exponentially distributed for tractability. Our work makes inroads into relaxing this restrictive assumption to allow modeling more realistic call center situations. Methodology: We use heavy traffic-motivated asymptotic queueing machinery that provides us the traction to successfully capture and incorporate the customer impatience distribution into the scheduling problem. In our approach, the scheduling problem reduces to a diffusion control problem, which we solve to propose near-optimal scheduling policies. Results: We propose near-optimal scheduling policies that can be implemented by call centers to improve their quality-of-service metrics. One of our main results is that, for a class of parameters, we establish sufficient conditions for both the optimality and nonoptimality of threshold policies. Managerial implications: Threshold policies are widely used for scheduling. Our work provides additional insight into whether these may be suboptimal.

Specifically, small scale systems can often benefit from full flexibility. Threshold type of control is then effective to prioritize patient types and to cope with patients having diverse lengths of stay. For large scale systems, we assert that a little flexibility is generally sufficient to take advantage of most of the economies of scale.

These values are reflected in quality-of-service targets. The prevalent target service factor (TSF) formulation requires, for example, that 80% of VIP customers wait less than 20 seconds while setting the target to 30 seconds for non-VIP customers. The call center must determine the staffing level together with a prioritization rule that meets these targets at minimal cost. In practice, because of the underlying complexity of these systems, the prioritization rule is often selected in a heuristic manner rather than being systematically optimized. When considering the universe of prioritization policies, index rules provide a customizable and easy to define heuristic and for this reason are implemented in various call center software packages.We use the TSF formulation as a stepping stone toward a better understanding of index rules. We first construct an asymptotically optimal solution for the TSF problem. The prioritization component of our solution is a tracking policy rather than an index rule. We prove that despite index rules' significant flexibility, no instance of these prioritization rules is optimal for the TSF problem. The suboptimality of index rules follows from an essential characteristic of these: restricting attention to index rules (as is heuristically done in practice) is asymptotically equivalent to requiring that a VIP customer always waits less than a regular (non-VIP) customer who arrives at the same time. This, in particular, implies that the use of index rules in practice can be rationalized if (and only if) the manager requires such strong differentiation.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0030-364X,,,,,,,,"Sejong Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul, South KoreaCornell Tech, Sch Operat Res & Informat Engn, New York, NY 10011 USA",Cornell Tech,,,2017-06-02,WOS:000401729900014,,,gurvich_et_al_2008

Once the arrival rate becomes known, the call center may be over-staffed, in which case staff are being paid to be idle, or under-staffed, in which case many callers hang-up in the face of long wait times. Firms that have chosen to keep their call center operations in-house can mitigate this problem by co-sourcing; that is, by sometimes outsourcing calls. Then, the required staffing N depends on how the firm chooses which calls to outsource in real time, after the arrival rate realizes and the call center operates as a M/M/N+M queue with an outsourcing option. Our objective is to find a joint policy for staffing and call outsourcing that minimizes the long-run average cost of this two-stage stochastic program when there is a linear staffing cost per unit time and linear costs associated with abandonments and outsourcing. We propose a policy that uses a square-root safety staffing rule, and outsources calls in accordance with a threshold rule that characterizes when the system is too crowded.

When the factors are relatively sparse, it may be more efficient to obtain nonzero elements of the generator matrix in Kronecker form on the fly and multiply them with corresponding elements of the vector.

This paper extends the form of the transition rates used recently so that a larger class of models including those of call centers can be analyzed for their steady-state. The challenge in the matrix analytic solution then is to compute conditional expected sojourn time matrices of the LDQBD model under low memory and time requirements after truncating its countably infinite state space judiciously. Results of numerical experiments are presented using a Kronecker-based matrix-analytic solution on models with two or more countably infinite dimensions and rules of thumb regarding better implementations are derived.

These dynamic routing and scheduling decisions are very difficult, because customers have different needs and servers have different skill levels. A further complication is that it is preferable that these decisions are made blindly; that is, they depend only on the system state and not on system parameter information such as call arrival rates and service speeds. This is because this information is generally not known with certainty. Ideally, a dynamic control policy for making routing and scheduling decisions balances customer and server needs by keeping customer delays low but still fairly dividing the workload amongst the various servers. In this paper, we propose a blind dynamic control policy for parallel-server systems with multiple customer classes and server pools that is based on the number of customers waiting and the number of agents idling.We show that in the Halfin-Whitt many-server heavy-traffic limiting regime, our proposed blind policy performs extremely well when the objective is to minimize customer holding costs subject to server fairness, as defined by how the system idleness is divided among servers. To do this, we formulate an approximating diffusion control problem (DCP) and compare the performance of the nonblind DCP solution to a feasible policy for the DCP that is blind. We establish that the increase in the DCP objective function value is small over a wide range of parameter values. We then use simulation to validate that a small increase in the DCP objective function value is indicative of our proposed blind policy performing very well.",,,,,,,,,37,5,0,0,0,0,42,,,0030-364X,,,,,,,,"Univ So Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USANYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA",,,,2013-05-05,WOS:000316115000017,,,gurvich_et_al_2008

We show that a state space collapse result holds in many-server heavy traffic if a corresponding deterministic hydrodynamic model satisfies a similar state space collapse condition. Unlike the single-server heavy traffic setting for multiclass queueing network, our hydrodynamic model is different from the standard fluid model for many-server queues. Our methodology is similar in spirit to that in Bramson [Bramson, M. 1998. State space collapse with application to heavy traffic limits for multiclass queueing networks. Queueing Systems 30 89-148.], which focuses on the single-server heavy traffic regime.

To minimize the impact of disruptions, a proper incentive mechanism has to be in place so that the suppliers provide prompt restoration and recovery services to the customer. A widely adopted incentive mechanism is performance-based contracting (PBC), in which suppliers receive compensation based on realized system uptime. A key obstacle is that disruptions occur infrequently, making it very expensive for a supplier to commit the necessary resources for recovery because they will be idle most of the time. In this paper, we show that designing a successful PBC creates nontrivial challenges that are unique to this environment. Namely, because of the infrequent and random nature of disruptions, a seemingly innocuous choice of performance measures used in contracts may create unexpected incentives, resulting in counterintuitive optimal behavior. We compare the efficiencies of two widely used contracts, one based on sample-average downtime and the other based on cumulative downtime, and identify the supplier's ability to influence the frequency of disruptions as an important factor in determining which contract performs better. We also show that implementing PBC may create high agency cost when equipment is very reliable. This counterintuitive situation arises because the realized downtimes from which the customer might intuit about the supplier's capacity investment are highly uncertain when there are not many samples of downtimes, i.e., when disruptions occur rarely.",,,,,,,,,86,10,0,0,1,0,95,,,0025-1909,1526-5501,,,,,,,"Yale Univ, Yale Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06511 USAUniv Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USAINSEAD, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France",,,,2010-09-01,WOS:000281715300008,,,gurvich_et_al_2008

We tackle these questions by characterizing control and staffing schemes that are asymptotically optimal in the limit, as the system load grows large. Our main finding is that a threshold priority control, in which cross-selling is exercised only if the number of callers in the system is below a certain threshold, is asymptotically optimal in great generality.

We formulate an optimization problem for a call center with heterogeneous agent pools, in which each pool is distinguished by the speed at which agents in that pool handle calls. The objective is to minimize steady-state expected customer wait time subject to a fairness constraint on the workload division.We first solve the optimization problem by formulating it as a Markov decision process (MDP), and solving, a related linear program. We note that this approach does not in general lead to an optimal policy that has a simple structure. Fortunately, the optimal policy does appear to have a simple structure as the system size grows large, in the Halfin-Whitt many-server heavy-traffic limit regime. Therefore, we solve the diffusion control problem that arises in this regime and interpret its solution as a policy for the original system. The resulting routing policy is a threshold policy that determines server pool priorities based on the total number of customers in the system. We prove that a continuous modification of our proposed threshold routing policy is asymptotically optimal in the Halfin-Whitt limit regime.

However, it may not be an easy task to determine the importance level of customers, especially when decisions need to be made under limited information. A typical example is from health care: When triage nurses classify patients into different priority groups, they must promptly determine each patient's criticality levels with only partial information on their conditions.We consider such a service system where customers are from one of two possible types. The service time and waiting cost for a customer depends on the customer's type. Customers' type identities are not directly available to the service provider; however, each customer provides a signal, which is an imperfect indicator of the customer's identity. The service provider uses these signals to determine priority levels for the customers with the objective of minimizing the long-run average waiting cost. In most of the paper, each customer's signal equals the probability that the customer belongs to the type that should have a higher priority and customers incur waiting costs that are linear in time. We first show that increasing the number of priority classes decreases costs, and the policy that gives the highest priority to the customer with the highest signal outperforms any finite class priority policy. We then focus on two-class priority policies and investigate how the optimal policy changes with the system load. We also investigate the properties of good signals and find that signals that are larger in convex ordering are more preferable. In a simulation study, we find that when the waiting cost functions are nondecreasing, quadratic, and convex, the policy that assigns the highest priority to the customer with the highest signal performs poorly while the two-class priority policy and an extension of the generalized c mu rule perform well.",,,,,,,,,35,1,0,0,0,0,36,,,1523-4614,1526-5498,,,,,,,"Univ N Carolina, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",,,,2009-09-01,WOS:000270304000009,,,gurvich_et_al_2008

This is equivalent to having the number of servers N being approximately equal to R+beta root R, where R is the offered load and beta is a positive constant. For the G/D-K/N queue in the QED regime, we analyze the virtual waiting time V-N(t), as N increases indefinitely. Assuming that the service-time distribution has a finite support (hence the D-K in G/D-K/N), it is shown that, in the limit, the scaled virtual waiting time (V) over cap (N)(t) = root NVN (t)/ES is representable as a supremum over a random weighted tree ( S denotes a service time). Informally, it is then argued that, for large N,(V) over cap (N)(t) approximate to (E < s > [(V) over cap (N)(t-S)]+(X) over cap (t) -beta)(+), t is an element of R;here.(E < s > [(V) over cap (N)(t-S)] is the averaging of (V) over cap (N)(t-S) over S, and the process (X) over cap (t) is zero-mean Gaussian that summarizes all relevant information about arrivals and service times (X) over cap (t) arises as a limit of an infinite-server (G/D-K/infinity) process, appropriately scaled). The results are obtained by using both combinatorial and probabilistic arguments.

However, our queueing-game-theoretic analysis reveals that when agents act strategically, they may choose to speed up under pooling in an attempt to serve more customers, thus undermining service quality.

For maximizing the call center's revenue, the call center manager exercises two levels of control: agent reservation for inbound calls and call outsourcing. Given the influence of waits on purchase probability, we investigate the strategy of outsourcing customers who have waited already as opposed to outsourcing customers directly at arrival. Academic/practical relevance: The main novelty of this article arises from the use of a single framework to investigate both the combination of agent reservation with outsourcing decisions, and a waiting time-based outsourcing strategy. The existing literature only considers these two strategies in isolation and is restricted to quantity-based decisions. From a practical viewpoint, our results aim to provide decision support tools that are directly implementable in a call center's routing software. Methodology: We apply a Markov decision process approach to optimize the manager's decisions. The particularity of our approach is that we use the experienced waiting time as a decision variable. Results: We prove that the optimal policy for reservation and outsourcing is of threshold type. Our main conclusion is that outsourcing customers after letting them wait in-house generates higher revenue than outsourcing calls at arrival. However, it is also detrimental to service quality. In addition, we identify contexts in which the difference between the two outsourcing strategies is significant. Managerial implications: Contrary to standard call center practices, which either consist of specialized teams for one type of call or only exercise one specific level of decision-making (reservation or outsourcing), we demonstrate the potential of partial outsourcing with partial reservation.

In fact, this is a well-established result in the literature when jobs cannot make decisions and servers and jobs are identical. An important corollary of this finding is that pooling queues improves social welfare in the aforementioned setting. We consider an observable multiserver queueing system that can be operated with either dedicated queues or a pooled one. Customers are delay-sensitive, and they decide to join or balk based on queue length information upon arrival; they are not subject to an external admission control. In this setting, we prove that, contrary to the common understanding, pooling queues can increase the long-run average sojourn time so much that the pooled system results in strictly smaller social welfare (and strictly smaller consumer surplus) than the dedicated system under certain conditions. Specifically, pooling queues hurts performance when the arrival-rate-to-service-rate ratio is large (e.g., greater than one) and the normalized service benefit is also large. We prove that the performance loss due to pooling queues can be significant. Our numerical studies demonstrate that pooling queues can decrease the social welfare (and consumer surplus) by more than 95%. The benefit of pooling is commonly believed to increase with system size. In contrast, we show that when delay-sensitive customers make rational joining decisions, the magnitude of the performance loss due to pooling can strictly increase with the system size.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,,,0025-1909,1526-5501,,,,,,,"Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USACox Automot Inc, Atlanta, GA 30319 USAUniv North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",Cox Automot Inc,,,2021-09-20,WOS:000694892700007,,,jouini_et_al_2008

In this article, we study the dynamic assignment of servers to different areas of a service system at the beginning of discrete time intervals, namely, shifts. The ability to reassign servers at discrete intervals, rather than continuously, introduces a partial flexibility that provides an opportunity for reducing the expected waiting time of customers. The problem is primarily motivated by an application to nurse staffing in emergency departments (EDs), where nurses can work in different areas of the ED, but their assignment can only be changed at the beginning of their shifts (typically 8-12 hours). To investigate the reassignment decision and its potential benefits, we consider a multiclass queueing system, where customers of each class differ in terms of their average service requirements and the holding cost incurred as they wait in the queues. We study a discrete-time fluid control problem to minimize transient holding costs over a finite horizon and show that an appropriate translation of the solution to the fluid control problem is asymptotically optimal for the original stochastic system. Through analysis of the fluid control problem we further obtain insights on the structure of good policies in the presence of the shift constraint. Leveraging these insights, we develop heuristic policies and use simulation to demonstrate their effectiveness in systems with dynamics often observed in EDs. We find that, in a parameter regime relevant to our motivating application, the partial flexibility introduced by reassigning servers at the beginning of shifts can substantially reduce the expected cost of the system-by 10%-50% in some parameter regimes-compared with the status quo, dedicated staffing.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,0030-364X,,,,,,,,"Columbia Business Sch, Div Decis Risk & Operat, New York, NY 10027 USAUniv Southern Calif Los Angeles, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USAUniv Toronto, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 3G8, Canada",Univ Southern Calif Los Angeles,,,2021-11-02,WOS:000709027800001,,,jouini_et_al_2008

In this paper, we formalize these empirical observations by developing a game-theoretic model to assess the performance of pooling when servers choose their capacities strategically and exhibit varying scopes of customer ownership, captured by two cost components, respectively, associated with the processing time and the waiting time of a server's customers. We show that the core benefits of pooling are mostly annihilated in this setting. In fact, for any given scope of customer ownership, the queue configuration has almost no impact on the customers' average throughput time unless (i) servers' degree of customer ownership is so low that they choose to operate at high utilization and (ii) they care much more about their customers' processing times than about their waiting times. Under these conditions, adopting a dedicated queue configuration can yield significantly lower throughput times.

The servers' additional idleness resulting from the dedicated structure will be negligible when the system scale is large.

Given that firms routinely offer a portfolio of vertically differentiated products, a crucial question facing such firms is whether such differentiation should also be extended to associated services. Service differentiation lowers cannibalization of the high-quality product by the low-quality product and increases revenues, but it requires dedicated capacity which increases the cost of offering service. This tradeoff is further confounded by the potential loss of service performance due to complexity involved in single set of resources serving multiple segments. Thus, we examine this service strategy decision along the two dimensions: cannibalization concerns and complexity involved in serving multiple segments together. We consider a firm whose customers vary in their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for product quality and their sensitivity to service levels, and can self-select across offered products. We find that even when there is no complexity involved in serving multiple segments, the differentiated service strategy may be preferred purely to prevent cannibalization. With high complexity, cannibalization concerns may increase or decrease the firm's preference for the differentiated service strategy depending on the demand mix of higher and lower WTP customers. Cannibalization also makes the role of total demand size in the service strategy decision more pronounced. Specifically, changes in capacity costs, customer heterogeneity and product differentiation may make the differentiated service strategy more or less attractive depending on the total demand size as well as the demand mix.

In this model, medical assistants (MAs) take a more central role in patient care and population health management. MAs' traditionally low status may give them a unique view on changing organizational dynamics and teamwork. However, little empirical work exists on how team-based organizational designs affect the experiences of low-status health care workers like MAs.Purposes: The aim of this study was to describe how team-based primary care affects the experiences of MAs. A secondary aim was to explore variation in these experiences.Methodology/Approach: In late 2014, the authors interviewed 30 MAs from nine primary care practices transitioning to team-based care. Interviews addressed job responsibilities, teamwork, implementation, job satisfaction, and learning. Data were analyzed using a thematic networks approach. Interviews also included closed-ended questions about workload and job satisfaction.Results: Most MAs reported both a higher workload (73%) and a greater job satisfaction (86%) under team-based primary care. Interview data surfaced four mechanisms for these results, which suggested more fulfilling work and greater respect for the MA role: (a) relationships with colleagues, (b) involvement with patients, (c) sense of control, and (d) sense of efficacy. Facilitators and barriers to these positive changes also emerged.Conclusion: Team-based care can provide low-status health care workers with more fulfilling work and strengthen relationships across status lines. The extent of this positive impact may depend on supporting factors at the organization, team, and individual worker levels.Practice Implications: To maximize the benefits of team-based care, primary care leaders should recognize the larger role that MAs play under this model and support them as increasingly valuable team members. Contingent on organizational conditions, practices may find MAs who are willing to manage the increased workload that often accompanies team-based care.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,0,15,,,0361-6274,1550-5030,,,,,,,"Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Hlth Policy Management, Cambridge, MA 02138 USAHarvard Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USABoston Childrens Hosp, Pediat, Boston, MA USAHarvard Med Sch, Populat Med, Boston, MA USAHarvard Pilgrim Hlth Inst, Boston, MA USAHarvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Econ & Policy, Boston, MA USAUniv Kansas, Sch Med, Hlth Policy & Management, Lawrence, KS 66045 USAHarvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Healthcare Management & Policy, Boston, MA USA",Harvard Pilgrim Hlth Inst,,,2018-04-03,WOS:000427794000004,27849646.0,,jouini_et_al_2008

High utilization can improve financial performance, but causes congestion, which increases throughput time. Employees may manage this trade-off by reducing processing times during periods of high workload, resulting in an inverted U-shaped relationship between utilization and throughput time. Using two years of inpatient data from 203 California hospitals, we find evidence that patient length of stay (LOS) increases as occupancy increases, until a tipping point, after which patients are discharged early to alleviate congestion. More interestingly, we find a second tipping point-at 93% occupancy-beyond which additional occupancy leads to a longer LOS. These results are indicative of a workload-related saturation effect where employees can no longer overcome high workload by speeding up. Our data suggest that the saturation effect is due to an increase in the workload requirements of the remaining patients. Collectively, we find that the underlying relationship between occupancy and LOS is N-shaped. Consequently, managers who seek cost efficiencies via a strategy of high utilization in tandem with speeding up may find that their strategy backfires because there is a point at which employees are no longer able to compensate for a high workload by working harder, and throughput time counterproductively increases. We perform a counterfactual analysis and find that an alternate strategy of employing flexible labor when faced with high occupancy levels might be a more productive approach, and could save the hospitals in our sample up to $138 million over 23 months.",,,,,,,,,90,1,0,0,0,0,91,,,0025-1909,1526-5501,,,,,,,"Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, Boston, MA 02215 USABrandeis Univ, Brandeis Int Business Sch, Waltham, MA 02453 USA",,,,2017-04-01,WOS:000399362100009,,,jouini_et_al_2008

Shared norms and attitudes concerning knowledge, IT use, and responsibility for different call types within teams were associated with redirecting practices which lead to the problematic rerouting of calls. Problems with call routing and rerouting negatively affected operational efficiency and undermined customer satisfaction.Research limitations/implications - The paper is based upon a single case study so further research is required to examine how problems identified are manifest in call centre operations of different size and complexity. The qualitative approach develops rich insights but these findings would benefit from a quantitative focus in the future.Practical implications - The customer experience of IVR systems should be continually monitored to identify usability problems and ensure effective design, while call centre management should attempt to increase teams' awareness of and ability to successfully redirect incorrectly routed calls.Originality/value - The paper conceptualises the mutual influence of macro-level service system design and the micro-level behaviour of customers and agents upon each other. In practice, formal design decisions such as input uncertainty, decoupling, and interdependence patterns are continually reproduced or modified. Shared attitudes and norms of teams and their behavioural influence upon agents' call handling practices are identified as a cause of coordination problems in call centres service systems.

Using an emergency department's (ED) patient-level data from 2007 to 2010, we find that patients' average wait time and LOS are longer when physicians are assigned patients under a pooled queuing system with a fairness constraint compared to a dedicated queuing system with the same fairness constraint. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find the dedicated queuing system is associated with a 17% decrease in average LOS and a 9% decrease in average wait time relative to the control group-a 39-minute reduction in LOS and a four-minute reduction in wait time for an average patient of medium severity in this ED. Interviews and observations of physicians suggest that the improved performance stems from the physicians' increased ownership over patients and resources that is afforded by a dedicated queuing system, which enables physicians to more actively manage the flow of patients into and out of ED beds. Our findings suggest that the benefits from improved flow management in a dedicated queuing system can be large enough to overcome the longer wait time predicted to arise from nonpooled queues. We conduct additional analyses to rule out alternate explanations for the reduced average wait time and LOS in the dedicated system, such as stinting and decreased quality of care.

The market we study consists of multiple competing call centers and many clients searching for outsourcing partners to answer their customers' phone calls. Through the perspective of operational efficiency, we create a single index that aggregates several contract parameters. The index can be used to segment the call center market as well as to estimate the contract prices at equilibrium. The results can help the call centers to locate and focus on their market niches. Clients can use the results to estimate the cost of their contracts and negotiate with the call centers for better deals. The results can also be used to explain the observed reshoring phenomenon in recent years from the perspective of operations management. In particular, our results suggest that call centers in low-wage locations have a competitive advantage on large contracts with very strict waiting time requirements. On the other hand, call centers in high-wage locations may still be attractive for contracts that have lower call volumes, shorter contract lengths, and/or less strict waiting time requirements. Finally, we present field studies from an international service provider with call centers in multiple locations.

If firms decide to operate a shared facility they must also decide on a scheme for sharing the capacity cost. We formulate the problem as a cooperative game and identify settings under which capacity sharing is beneficial and there is a cost allocation that is in the core under either the first-come, first-served policy or an optimal priority policy.

Prior research on coordination in temporary groups describes how roles encode individual responsibilities so that coordination between relative strangers is possible. We extend this research by introducing key tenets from team effectiveness research to theorize when role-based coordination might be more or less effective. We develop these ideas in a multimethod study of a hospital emergency department (ED) redesign. Before the redesign, people coordinated in ad hoc groupings, which provided flexibility because any nurse could work with any doctor, but these groupings were limited in effectiveness because people were not accountable to each other for progress, did not have shared understanding of their work, and faced interpersonal risks when reaching out to other roles. The redesign introduced new mesolevel structures that bounded a set of roles (rather than a set of specific individuals, as in a team) and gave them collective responsibility for a whole task. We conceptualized the mesolevel structures as team scaffolds and found that they embodied the logic of both role and team structures. The team scaffolds enabled small-group interactions to take the form of an actual team process with team-level prioritizing, updating, and helping, based on newfound accountability, overlapping representations of work, and belonging-despite the lack of stable team composition. Quantitative data revealed changes to the coordination patterns in the ED (captured through a two-mode network) after the team scaffolds were implemented and showed a 40% improvement in patient throughput time.",,,,,,,,,113,0,0,0,2,0,113,,,1047-7039,,,,,,,,"Stanford Univ, Palo Alto, CA 94305 USAHarvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA",,,,2015-06-17,WOS:000355095100006,,,jouini_et_al_2008

The purpose of this paper is to analyze a representative telephone response system of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals, address the existing inefficiency issues such as long call waiting time, and improve system resilience to changes.Design/methodology/approach - Resource sharing schemes are proposed to improve the system performance in answering calls related to appointment booking and medication renewal. Discrete event simulation is adopted to model the current system and the resource sharing schemes.Findings - The resource sharing schemes dramatically improve system performance reflected by the decrease of call waiting time and queue, as well as the extreme high utilization of agents in a key unit. Compared with the less desired alternative of hiring additional employees to mitigate the performance issues, the resource sharing schemes perform at par or even better. Sharing more resource during the peak hours can further balance the agent workload.Practical implications - The resource sharing schemes could alleviate staffing shortage, long waiting time, and high-abandonment rate in the bottle-beck unit of the system, and lead to better utilization of scarce resources on the hospital floor. The concept reflects localized centralization efforts in traditionally highly decentralized telephone operations in hospital systems.Originality/value - This research provides a structured approach to analyze the operations of a VA telephone response system.

We study the problem of announcing delays to customers upon their arrival. For the simplest model without reneging, we give a method to estimate virtual delays that is used within the announcement step. For the second model, we first build the call center model incorporating reneging. The model takes into account the change in customer behavior that may occur when delay information is communicated to them. In particular, it is assumed that customer reneging is replaced by balking that depends on the state of the system in this case.

Fully cross-training workers in DRC heterogeneous systems is only beneficial if the differences between mean processing times are not too large, otherwise cross-training should be pursued within homogeneous subgroups of machines. Due to the limited machine availability, DRC systems are unable to use some of the potential assignment flexibility from cross-trained workers (pooled queues) that can be used in SRC systems. However, it appears that this restriction in the DRC system may even improve the system mean flow (waiting) time performance compared to the SRC system for relatively large differences in processing time.
